  <summary>01: Spring Framework</summary>

### Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is an open-source application framework for the Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust, enterprise-level Java applications. Its primary goal is to simplify Java EE development and promote good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.

### Core Concepts

* **Inversion of Control (IoC) (IMP):** This principle transfers the control of object creation and management from your application code to the Spring container. Instead of your objects creating their dependencies, the container creates and "injects" them.
  * **Real-life Analogy:** You don't build your own car from parts (managing dependencies yourself). You go to a factory (the IoC container), which assembles the car with all its components (dependencies) and gives you the finished product.
  * The **ApplicationContext** is the central interface for providing configuration information to the application and is the heart of the IoC container.
* **Dependency Injection (DI) (IMP):** This is the primary mechanism by which IoC is implemented. The dependencies an object needs are "injected" into it by the container.

| Injection Type | Description | Best For | Common Pitfalls |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Constructor** | Dependencies are provided through the class constructor. | Mandatory dependencies, creating immutable objects. | Can lead to large constructors if there are many dependencies. |
| **Setter** | Dependencies are provided through setter methods after object instantiation. | Optional dependencies that can be changed. | Objects can exist in an incomplete or inconsistent state. |
| **Field** | Dependencies are injected directly into the fields using `@Autowired`. | Rapid prototyping (generally discouraged). | Hard to unit test, hides dependencies, and violates encapsulation. |

    **Best Practice:** Always prefer **constructor injection**. It ensures that an object is created in a valid state with all its required dependencies and makes the class easier to test in isolation.
    
    ```java
    @Component
    public class MyService {
        private final MyRepository repository;
    
        // Constructor Injection
        @Autowired
        public MyService(MyRepository repository) {
            this.repository = repository;
        }
    }
    ```
    * **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) (IMP):** AOP complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by allowing you to modularize cross-cutting concerns. These are concerns that affect multiple points of an application, such as logging, security, and transaction management.
    * **Real-life Analogy:** Think of AOP as a security team in an office building. Instead of each office (object) having its own security guard (code), a central security team (Aspect) monitors specific entry points (Join Points) like elevators and main doors (Pointcuts) to perform security checks (Advice).
    * **Key Terminology:**
        * **Aspect:** A module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern (e.g., logging).
        * **Join Point:** A specific point during the execution of a program, such as a method execution or exception handling.
        * **Advice:** The action taken by an aspect at a particular join point (e.g., `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`).
        * **Pointcut:** An expression that selects the join points where advice should be applied.
        * **Weaving:** The process of linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object.


### Spring vs. Spring Boot

A very common interview question is to differentiate between the Spring Framework and Spring Boot.


| Feature | Spring Framework | Spring Boot |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Primary Goal** | To provide a flexible, unopinionated framework for Java EE. | To simplify the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. |
| **Configuration** | Requires explicit XML or Java `@Configuration`. | Provides **auto-configuration** based on the classpath and property settings. |
| **Boilerplate Code** | Significant boilerplate code for setup and configuration. | Drastically reduces boilerplate with starter dependencies and conventions. |
| **Server** | Requires deploying a WAR file to an external web server. | Includes an **embedded server** (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) by default. |
| **Dependency Management** | Requires manual management of compatible library versions. | Manages dependency versions via `spring-boot-starter-parent` or a BOM. |
| **Approach** | Unopinionated, giving developers many choices. | Opinionated, providing sensible defaults but allowing easy overrides. |

  <summary>02: Spring Boot Introduction</summary>

### Section 2: Spring Boot Introduction

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework built on top of the Spring Framework. Its primary goal is to make it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can "just run." It achieves this through auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and an embedded server.

#### The `@SpringBootApplication` Annotation (IMP)

This single annotation is the entry point of a Spring Boot application and is a combination of three key annotations:

* **`@EnableAutoConfiguration`**: Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism. It attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the JAR dependencies you have added. For example, if `spring-boot-starter-web` is on the classpath, it auto-configures Tomcat and Spring MVC.
* **`@ComponentScan`**: Tells Spring to scan for components, configurations, and services in the current package and its sub-packages.
* **`@SpringBootConfiguration`**: A specialized form of `@Configuration`. It is semantically equivalent but also allows Spring Boot to find your main configuration class for features like integration tests (`@SpringBootTest`).

| Annotation | vs | `@Configuration` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`@SpringBootConfiguration`** |  | A standard Spring annotation to declare a configuration class. |
| A Spring Boot-specific marker. |  | Can be used multiple times in an application. |
| Used once per application. |  | Does not have special test support like its counterpart. |

#### Customizing Application Startup

* **`SpringApplicationBuilder`**: A fluent builder API for creating and customizing a `SpringApplication`. It's useful for more complex setups.

```java
// Example: Disabling the banner and setting the web application type
new SpringApplicationBuilder(MyApplication.class)
    .bannerMode(Banner.Mode.OFF)
    .web(WebApplicationType.SERVLET)
    .run(args);
```

* **`WebApplicationType`**: Tells Spring Boot what kind of application to run.
  * **`SERVLET`**: For traditional servlet-based web applications (e.g., Spring MVC). This is the default if `spring-boot-starter-web` is present.
  * **`REACTIVE`**: For reactive web applications (e.g., Spring WebFlux). This is the default if `spring-boot-starter-webflux` is present.
  * **`NONE`**: The application should not run as a web application.
* **Lazy Initialization**: You can configure beans to be created only when they are first requested, rather than at startup.
  * **Property**: `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true`
  * **Benefit**: Can significantly speed up application startup time.
  * **Pitfall**: Can hide configuration errors until the bean is actually used. A request might fail because a bean cannot be created, which would have been caught at startup otherwise.
* **Banner Customization**: To change the startup banner, add a `banner.txt` file to your `src/main/resources` directory. You can disable it with `spring.main.banner-mode=off`.


#### Beans, Dependency Injection, and Scopes

* **Bean and its Lifecycle (IMP)**: A bean is an object managed by the Spring IoC container. Its lifecycle is:

1. **Instantiate**: The container creates an instance of the bean.
2. **Populate Properties**: Dependencies are injected (DI).
3. **Aware Interfaces**: `BeanNameAware`, `BeanFactoryAware`, `ApplicationContextAware` methods are called.
4. **Pre-Initialization**: Methods annotated with `@PostConstruct` are executed.
5. **Initialization**: `afterPropertiesSet()` of `InitializingBean` is called.
6. **Post-Initialization**: Bean is now ready. (This is where AOP proxies are applied).
7. **In Use**: The bean is available for the application to use.
8. **Destruction**: When the container shuts down, methods annotated with `@PreDestroy` are called, followed by the `destroy()` method of `DisposableBean`.
* **Constructor vs. Field vs. Setter Injection (IMP)**:
  * **Best Practice**: **Always use constructor injection.** It ensures dependencies are `final`, prevents circular dependencies at compile time, and makes objects immutable. Field injection is convenient but makes testing harder and hides dependencies.
* **`@Lookup` for Prototype Injection in Singleton (IMP)**:
  * **Problem**: When you inject a `prototype`-scoped bean into a `singleton`-scoped bean, only one instance of the prototype is created and injected at startup. You don't get a new instance every time you need one.
  * **Solution**: The `@Lookup` annotation tells Spring to override a method and return a new prototype instance from the container on every call.
  * **Analogy**: A singleton is a factory manager (created once). A prototype is a product (needed fresh each time). The `@Lookup` method is the button the manager presses to get a new product off the assembly line.

```java
@Component // Singleton by default
public abstract class SingletonBean {

    @Lookup // Asks Spring to create a new instance every time this method is called
    public abstract PrototypeBean getPrototypeBean();

    public void usePrototype() {
        PrototypeBean bean = getPrototypeBean(); // A new instance is returned here
        // ... use the bean
    }
}
```

* **`@Value` vs `@ConfigurationProperties` (IMP)**:

| Feature | `@Value("${...}")` | `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="...")` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Usage** | Injects a single property value. | Binds a whole group of properties to a POJO. |
| **Type Safety** | Low. It's essentially string-based. | High. Full type-safe binding to fields. |
| **Validation** | No built-in validation. | Supports JSR-303 validation (`@Validated`). |
| **Flexibility** | Not suitable for hierarchical or complex properties. | Excellent for structured, hierarchical properties (e.g., nested objects, lists). |
| **Best Practice** | Use for simple, one-off values. | **Recommended** for all structured application configuration. |

* **Circular Dependency Resolution (IMP)**:
  * **Problem**: Bean A depends on Bean B, and Bean B depends on Bean A.
  * **How Spring Handles It**: For **singleton** beans using **setter or field injection**, Spring resolves it by creating a proxy of the first bean and injecting it before it's fully initialized.
  * **Pitfall**: **Constructor injection will fail** with a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`. This is a good thing, as it often points to a design smell.
  * **Workaround**: You can use `@Lazy` on one of the constructor parameters to break the cycle by creating one of the beans lazily.
* **Bean Scopes (IMP)**:

| Scope | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **`singleton`** | (Default) Only one instance of the bean is created per container. |
| **`prototype`** | A new instance is created every time the bean is requested. |
| **`request`** | One instance per HTTP request (only valid in a web-aware `ApplicationContext`). |
| **`session`** | One instance per HTTP session (only valid in a web-aware `ApplicationContext`). |
| **`application`** | One instance per `ServletContext` (only valid in a web-aware `ApplicationContext`). |

  <summary>03: Annotation</summary>

### Section 3: Annotation

Annotations are a form of metadata that provides information to the Spring container. They are used extensively in modern Spring applications to configure components, manage dependencies, and define application behavior, drastically reducing the need for XML-based configuration.

#### Stereotype Annotations (IMP)

These annotations are used to mark classes as Spring components. The `@ComponentScan` process discovers these classes and registers them as beans in the `ApplicationContext`.


| Annotation | Purpose \& Semantic Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| **`@Component`** | The generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. It is the base for all other stereotypes. |
| **`@Service`** | Indicates that a class holds business logic. It's a specialization of `@Component` for the **service layer**. |
| **`@Repository`** | Marks a class as a Data Access Object (DAO) in the **persistence layer**. It enables exception translation, converting platform-specific exceptions (like `SQLException`) into Spring's unified `DataAccessException` hierarchy. |
| **`@Controller`** | Identifies a class as a Spring MVC controller in the **presentation layer**. Typically used with view-based technologies where methods return a view name. |
| **`@RestController`** | A convenience annotation that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It marks a controller where every method's return value is written directly to the HTTP response body as JSON/XML, making it ideal for building REST APIs. |
| **`@Configuration`** | Declares a class as a source of bean definitions. Methods annotated with `@Bean` inside a `@Configuration` class produce beans managed by the Spring container. |

**Best Practice:** Use the most specific annotation that fits your component's role. This improves readability and allows for specialized framework behavior (like exception translation with `@Repository`).

#### Dependency Injection Annotations (IMP)

These annotations are used to wire beans together.

* **`@Autowired`**: Spring's primary annotation for dependency injection. It can be used on constructors, setters, or fields.
  * **Spring Version Note:** Before Spring 4.3, `@Autowired` was required on constructors. Now, if a class has only one constructor, the annotation is optional.
* **`@Qualifier("beanName")`**: Used alongside `@Autowired` to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type exist. You specify which bean to inject by its name.

```java
public interface MessageService {
    String getMessage();
}

@Component("emailService")
public class EmailService implements MessageService { /* ... */ }

@Component("smsService")
public class SmsService implements MessageService { /* ... */ }

@Component
public class NotificationManager {
    private final MessageService messageService;

    // Autowire the specific "smsService" bean
    public NotificationManager(@Qualifier("smsService") MessageService messageService) {
        this.messageService = messageService;
    }
}
```

* **`@Primary`**: When multiple beans of the same type are available, `@Primary` marks one bean as the default choice to be injected if no `@Qualifier` is specified.
  * **Common Pitfall**: If you have one bean marked as `@Primary` and use a `@Qualifier` to inject another, the `@Qualifier` always wins. `@Primary` is just a default.
* **`@Resource(name="beanName")`**: A JSR-250 standard annotation. It works similarly to `@Autowired` with `@Qualifier`. By default, it injects by name. If no name is specified, it falls back to matching by type.


#### Web Annotations (Spring MVC/WebFlux) (IMP)

These are used to handle web requests.

* **`@RequestMapping("/path")`**: The general-purpose mapping annotation. Can be used at the class level to define a base path and at the method level for specific endpoints.
* **HTTP Method Shortcuts**: More specific versions of `@RequestMapping` that improve clarity.
  * **`@GetMapping`**: For HTTP GET requests.
  * **`@PostMapping`**: For HTTP POST requests.
  * **`@PutMapping`**: For HTTP PUT requests.
  * **`@DeleteMapping`**: For HTTP DELETE requests.
  * **`@PatchMapping`**: For HTTP PATCH requests.
* **Method Parameter Annotations**: Used to extract information from the request.
  * **`@PathVariable`**: Binds a method parameter to a URI template variable (e.g., `/users/{id}`).
  * **`@RequestParam`**: Binds a method parameter to a request parameter (e.g., `/users?sort=asc`).
  * **`@RequestBody`**: Binds the HTTP request body to a method parameter (typically a DTO). Spring uses `HttpMessageConverters` to deserialize the body into an object.
  * **`@RequestHeader`**: Binds a method parameter to a request header.
* **`@ResponseBody`**: Indicates that a method's return value should be bound to the web response body. This is automatically included in `@RestController`.

**Example Controller Snippet:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // ... logic to fetch user
        return user; // Automatically serialized to JSON
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody UserDTO userDto) {
        // ... logic to create user
        return new ResponseEntity<>(createdUser, HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>04: ResponseEntity and ResponseCodes</summary>

### Section 4: ResponseEntity and ResponseCodes

In a Spring-based REST API, you can return a domain object directly from a `@RestController` method, and Spring will automatically serialize it to JSON and return an HTTP `200 OK` status. However, for more control over the response, **`ResponseEntity`** is the preferred tool.

#### What is `ResponseEntity`? (IMP)

`ResponseEntity` is a powerful and flexible class that represents the entire HTTP response. It allows you to control everything:

* The **HTTP status code**.
* The **HTTP headers**.
* The **response body**.

**Real-life Analogy:** Returning a plain object (`User`) is like handing someone a product in a clear plastic bag. It works, but it's basic. Using `ResponseEntity` is like placing the product in a custom-designed box (`body`), with a shipping label (`headers`), and a "Fragile" or "Priority" sticker (`status code`). It gives the receiver complete context about the package.

#### Why Use `ResponseEntity`? (IMP)

You should use `ResponseEntity` when you need to:

1. **Return different status codes based on the outcome.** For example, return `201 Created` for a successful creation, `404 Not Found` if an item doesn't exist, or `400 Bad Request` for validation errors.
2. **Add custom headers** to the response. For example, adding a `Location` header after creating a resource to point to the new resource's URI.
3. **Return a response without a body**, which is common for `204 No Content`.

#### Common HTTP Status Codes (ResponseCodes)

It's crucial to use the correct HTTP status code to build a semantically correct REST API.


| Status Code | `HttpStatus` Enum | Meaning \& Common Use Case |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **200** | `OK` | The request succeeded. Used for successful GET, PUT, PATCH requests. |
| **201** | `CREATED` | The request succeeded, and a new resource was created. Used for POST. |
| **204** | `NO_CONTENT` | The server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content. Used for DELETE. |
| **400** | `BAD_REQUEST` | The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| **401** | `UNAUTHORIZED` | The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. (Authentication is required). |
| **403** | `FORBIDDEN` | The client does not have access rights to the content. (Authorization failed). |
| **404** | `NOT_FOUND` | The server cannot find the requested resource. The most common error. |
| **409** | `CONFLICT` | The request conflicts with the current state of the server (e.g., creating a resource that already exists). |
| **500** | `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle. A generic "catch-all" server error. |

#### Code Examples

**Best Practice:** Use the static builder methods on `ResponseEntity` for cleaner and more readable code.

**1. Returning `201 Created` with a `Location` header:**

```java
@PostMapping("/users")
public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody UserDTO userDto) {
    User createdUser = userService.createUser(userDto);

    // Build the URI of the newly created resource
    URI location = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest()
            .path("/{id}")
            .buildAndExpand(createdUser.getId())
            .toUri();

    // Use ResponseEntity.created() to set status to 201 and add Location header
    return ResponseEntity.created(location).body(createdUser);
}
```

**2. Returning `404 Not Found`:**

```java
@GetMapping("/users/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
    Optional<User> userOptional = userService.findById(id);

    return userOptional
            .map(user -> ResponseEntity.ok(user)) // If user is present, return 200 OK
            .orElseGet(() -> ResponseEntity.notFound().build()); // Otherwise, return 404 Not Found
}
```

**3. Returning `204 No Content` for a successful deletion:**

```java
@DeleteMapping("/users/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
    userService.deleteById(id);
    return ResponseEntity.noContent().build(); // Returns 204 with no body
}
```

**Common Pitfall:** Returning a complex object directly in a `@RestController` when the business logic could lead to different outcomes. This forces a `200 OK` even if, for example, a search returned no results. It's better to wrap the response in a `ResponseEntity` to return a `404 Not Found` in such cases.

<details>
  <summary>05: Exception Handling</summary>

### Section 5: Exception Handling

Proper exception handling is crucial for building robust and user-friendly REST APIs. Spring Boot provides several powerful mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully, allowing you to separate error-handling logic from business logic and return meaningful, structured error responses to the client.

#### Centralized Exception Handling with `@ControllerAdvice` (IMP)

The most common and recommended approach is to use a class annotated with `@ControllerAdvice`. This annotation allows you to consolidate your exception handling logic into a single, global component.

**Real-life Analogy:** A `@ControllerAdvice` class is like a hospital's emergency room. Instead of each department (controller) having its own way of dealing with emergencies (exceptions), all emergencies are sent to a central ER. The ER has specialists (`@ExceptionHandler` methods) trained to handle specific types of injuries (exceptions), ensuring consistent and effective treatment.

An `@ExceptionHandler` method is used within a `@ControllerAdvice` class to define the response for a specific exception type.

**Code Example:**
A custom exception for when a resource is not found.

```java
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public ResourceNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

A simple error response DTO.

```java
public class ErrorResponse {
    private int statusCode;
    private String message;
    private long timestamp;
    // Getters and setters
}
```

The `@ControllerAdvice` class itself.

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex, WebRequest request) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse();
        errorResponse.setStatusCode(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value());
        errorResponse.setMessage(ex.getMessage());
        errorResponse.setTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());

        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) // For @Valid validation failures
    public ResponseEntity<Map<String, String>> handleValidationExceptions(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
        Map<String, String> errors = new HashMap<>();
        ex.getBindingResult().getAllErrors().forEach((error) -> {
            String fieldName = ((FieldError) error).getField();
            String errorMessage = error.getDefaultMessage();
            errors.put(fieldName, errorMessage);
        });
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errors, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class) // A generic catch-all handler
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleGlobalException(Exception ex, WebRequest request) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse();
        errorResponse.setStatusCode(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value());
        errorResponse.setMessage("An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.");
        errorResponse.setTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());

        // Best Practice: Log the actual exception for debugging
        // log.error("Unhandled exception: ", ex);

        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

**Best Practices for `@ControllerAdvice`:**

* **Be Specific:** Create specific exception handlers for your custom business exceptions (`ResourceNotFoundException`, `DuplicateResourceException`, etc.).
* **Handle Validation Errors:** Provide a handler for `MethodArgumentNotValidException` to return clear messages about which fields failed validation.
* **Have a Catch-All Handler:** Include a generic `ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)` as a fallback for any unexpected errors. This prevents stack traces from being leaked to the client and ensures a consistent error format.
* **Use a Standard Error DTO:** Define a consistent JSON structure for all your error responses (like `ErrorResponse` above). This makes it easier for clients to parse errors.


#### `ResponseStatusException` (IMP)

Introduced in Spring 5, `ResponseStatusException` is a programmatic way to trigger an HTTP status code from your business logic without needing a custom exception handler. It's useful for simple cases where you don't need a complex error body.

* **When to use it:** When you want to quickly return a standard HTTP error from your service layer without creating a custom exception class and handler.

**Code Example:**

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    public User findById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "User with id " + id + " not found"));
    }
}
```

**Common Pitfall**: Overusing `ResponseStatusException`. While convenient, it mixes HTTP concerns (status codes) with your service layer logic. For complex applications, a `@ControllerAdvice` with custom exceptions is a cleaner, more maintainable approach because it separates concerns.


| Method | Best For | Pros | Cons |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`@ControllerAdvice`** | Centralized, application-wide exception handling. | **Separation of Concerns**, consistent error responses, highly reusable. | Requires more boilerplate code (custom exceptions, DTOs). |
| **`ResponseStatusException`** | Simple, one-off error cases directly within business logic. | Quick and concise, no need for extra classes. | **Mixes concerns**, harder to maintain a consistent error response format. |

#### Spring Boot's Default Error Handling

If you don't define any custom exception handling, Spring Boot's "Whitelabel Error Page" will handle all errors. For REST requests, it returns a default JSON response:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-09-22T13:45:00.000+00:00",
    "status": 404,
    "error": "Not Found",
    "path": "/api/users/999"
}
```

You can customize this default behavior using `server.error.*` properties in `application.properties`, but `@ControllerAdvice` provides far more power and flexibility.

  <summary>06: AOP</summary>

### Section 6: AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of **cross-cutting concerns**. These are functionalities required in many places throughout an application but are not part of the core business logic. Examples include logging, security, transaction management, and caching.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
Imagine you are directing a play.

* **The Play's Script (Business Logic):** This is the main story and dialogue performed by your actors (`@Service`, `@Controller` methods).
* **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** These are tasks that happen across multiple scenes but aren't part of the core script, such as **lighting**, **sound effects**, and **opening/closing the curtains**.
* **AOP (The Stage Crew):** Instead of writing "turn on spotlights" in every scene's script, you have a specialized stage crew (an **Aspect**). This crew is given instructions on *when* and *where* to perform their tasks.
  * **Join Point:** Any specific moment in the play (e.g., an actor entering the stage, a line being spoken).
  * **Pointcut:** The instruction telling the crew where to act (e.g., "turn on the spotlight **every time the lead actor enters stage left**").
  * **Advice:** The action itself (e.g., turning on the spotlight, playing a sound effect).
  * **Weaving:** The process of combining the crew's actions with the actors' performance during rehearsal to create the final, seamless show.

AOP allows you to keep your business logic clean and focused, while your technical concerns are handled centrally and non-intrusively.

#### Core AOP Terminology (IMP)

* **Aspect:** A class that implements a cross-cutting concern. In Spring, it's a class annotated with `@Aspect`.
* **Join Point:** A point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method. In Spring AOP, a join point is **always** the execution of a method.
* **Advice:** The action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Spring AOP provides several types of advice.
* **Pointcut:** A predicate or expression that matches join points. The advice is run at any join point matched by the pointcut.
* **Target Object:** The object being advised by one or more aspects (the object containing the join point).
* **AOP Proxy:** An object created by the AOP framework to implement the aspect contracts. In Spring, this is either a JDK dynamic proxy or a CGLIB proxy.
* **Weaving:** The process of linking aspects with other application objects to create an advised proxy. This can be done at compile time, load time, or runtime. Spring AOP performs weaving at **runtime**.


#### Types of Advice (IMP)

| Annotation | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **`@Before`** | Advice that executes **before** a join point, but which cannot prevent the join point from proceeding. |
| **`@AfterReturning`** | Advice that executes **after** a join point completes normally (i.e., does not throw an exception). |
| **`@AfterThrowing`** | Advice that executes if a method exits by **throwing an exception**. |
| **`@After`** | Advice that executes **regardless** of how the join point exits (whether by normal return or by throwing an exception). |
| **`@Around`** | The most powerful advice. It "surrounds" a join point. It can perform custom behavior **before and after** the method invocation and is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own return value or throwing an exception. |

**Common Pitfall:** Forgetting to call `proceedingJoinPoint.proceed()` inside an `@Around` advice. If you don't call it, the original target method will **never execute**.

#### How to Implement AOP in Spring Boot

1. **Add the dependency:** Ensure you have `spring-boot-starter-aop` in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. **Create an Aspect:** Create a class and annotate it with `@Aspect` and `@Component`.
3. **Define a Pointcut and Advice:** Use annotations to define when and what code should run.

**Code Example: A Logging Aspect**

Let's create an aspect that logs the execution time of any method annotated with a custom `@LogExecutionTime` annotation.

**Step A: Create the custom annotation.**

```java
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface LogExecutionTime {
}
```

**Step B: Create the Aspect.**

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggingAspect.class);

    // Pointcut that matches any method annotated with @LogExecutionTime
    @Pointcut("@annotation(com.example.aop.LogExecutionTime)")
    public void logExecutionTimePointcut() {}

    @Around("logExecutionTimePointcut()")
    public Object logExecutionTime(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

        // Proceed with the original method execution
        Object result = joinPoint.proceed();

        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long executionTime = endTime - startTime;

        logger.info("{} executed in {} ms", joinPoint.getSignature(), executionTime);

        return result;
    }
}
```

**Step C: Use the annotation on a service method.**

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    @LogExecutionTime
    public void performSomeTask() {
        // Simulate a task that takes some time
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, whenever `performSomeTask()` is called, the `logExecutionTime` advice will automatically wrap the call, measure its execution time, and log it, without cluttering the business logic inside `MyService`.

  <summary>07: Transactional Annotation</summary>

### Section 7: @Transactional Annotation

The `@Transactional` annotation is a cornerstone of Spring's support for transaction management. It provides a declarative way to control transaction boundaries, ensuring that a sequence of operations (like database reads and writes) are executed as a single, atomic unit of work.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
A database transaction is like making a bank transfer online. The process involves two steps:

1. Withdrawing money from your account.
2. Depositing that money into the recipient's account.

This entire transfer must be **atomic**. If the withdrawal succeeds but the deposit fails, the money is lost. `@Transactional` acts as a "safety net" that wraps both operations. If any step fails, it automatically **rolls back** the entire process, ensuring the withdrawal is undone and your account balance is restored. If everything succeeds, it **commits** the changes, making them permanent.

#### How it Works

Spring's declarative transaction management is implemented using **AOP proxies**. When you annotate a method with `@Transactional`, Spring creates a proxy around the object. When the method is called, the proxy begins a transaction before the method executes.

* If the method completes successfully (without throwing an unchecked exception), the proxy commits the transaction.
* If the method throws a **`RuntimeException`** or an **`Error`** (unchecked exceptions), the proxy rolls back the transaction.
* **Common Pitfall (IMP):** By default, checked exceptions (e.g., `IOException`, custom `Exception` subclasses) do **not** trigger a rollback. This is a frequent source of bugs.


#### Key Attributes of `@Transactional` (IMP)

* **`propagation`**: Defines how transactions relate to each other when one transactional method calls another.

| Propagation Level | Description | Analogy (A team working on a task) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`REQUIRED`** (Default) | If a transaction exists, join it. If not, create a new one. | A team member joins the ongoing task. If no one is working, they start it. |
| **`SUPPORTS`** | If a transaction exists, join it. If not, execute non-transactionally. | A member helps if the task is ongoing but won't start it themselves. |
| **`MANDATORY`** | If a transaction exists, join it. If not, throw an exception. | A member who only joins existing tasks and complains if there's none to join. |
| **`REQUIRES_NEW`** | **Always starts a new, independent transaction.** Suspends the current transaction if one exists. | A manager starting a completely new, separate task, pausing their old one. |
| **`NOT_SUPPORTED`** | Executes non-transactionally. Suspends the current transaction if one exists. | A member who refuses to join any task and works independently. |
| **`NEVER`** | Executes non-transactionally. Throws an exception if a transaction exists. | A member who refuses to work if any task is already in progress. |
| **`NESTED`** | Starts a "nested" transaction if a transaction exists, which is a savepoint. If no transaction exists, it behaves like `REQUIRED`. (Not all transaction managers support this). | A member creates a sub-task. If the sub-task fails, only it is undone, not the main task. |

* **`isolation`**: Defines the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from the data modifications made by any other transaction.

| Isolation Level | Description | Can Lead To... |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`READ_UNCOMMITTED`** | Lowest level. One transaction can read uncommitted changes from another. | Dirty Reads, Non-Repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads. |
| **`READ_COMMITTED`** | Guarantees a transaction only reads committed data. (Many DBs default). | Non-Repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads. |
| **`REPEATABLE_READ`** | Guarantees that if a row is read multiple times in a transaction, the result is the same. (MySQL default). | Phantom Reads. |
| **`SERIALIZABLE`** | Highest level. Completely isolates transactions. Executes them serially. | Poor performance and scalability due to high locking. |

    *   **Dirty Read**: Reading data that has been modified but not yet committed.
    *   **Non-Repeatable Read**: Re-reading a row gets different values because another transaction has modified and committed it.
    *   **Phantom Read**: Re-running a query returns a different number of rows because another transaction has inserted or deleted rows.
    * **`readOnly`** (boolean): A hint to the transaction manager that the transaction will only perform read operations.
    * **Best Practice (IMP):** Always set `readOnly = true` for methods that only read data (e.g., `find`, `get`, `search`). This can be a significant performance optimization for some databases (e.g., JPA can avoid dirty checking).

```java
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public List<User> getAllUsers() {
    return userRepository.findAll();
}
```

* **`rollbackFor`** and **`noRollbackFor`**: Used to customize rollback behavior.
  * **`rollbackFor = CustomCheckedException.class`**: Forces a rollback when a specific checked exception is thrown.
  * **`noRollbackFor = SpecificRuntimeException.class`**: Prevents a rollback when a specific unchecked exception is thrown.


#### Placement of `@Transactional`

* **Best Practice:** Always place `@Transactional` on **concrete service-level methods**, not on repository interfaces or private methods.
* **Reasoning:**
  * The annotation only works on **public methods** of Spring-proxied beans.
  * A self-invocation (calling a `@Transactional` method from another method within the same class) will **bypass the proxy** and no transaction will be started.

**Correct Usage:**

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Transactional // Transaction starts here
    public User createUserAndSendEmail(UserDTO userDto) {
        User user = new User(userDto.getName());
        userRepository.save(user);
        // imagine emailService call here
        return user;
    }
}
```

**Incorrect Usage (Self-Invocation Problem):**

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Transactional
    public void create(UserDTO userDto) { // This method is transactional
        // ...
    }

    public void processUsers(List<UserDTO> dtos) {
        for (UserDTO dto : dtos) {
            this.create(dto); // WRONG: This call bypasses the proxy. No new transaction per user.
        }
    }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>08: Async Annotations</summary>

### Section 8: @Async Annotation

The `@Async` annotation in Spring allows a method to be executed asynchronously in a separate thread. This is a powerful feature for offloading long-running, non-blocking tasks from the main request-processing thread, thereby improving application responsiveness and throughput.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
Imagine ordering a coffee at a busy café.

* **Synchronous (Without `@Async`):** You place your order, and you stand at the counter, waiting, blocking the line behind you, until your coffee is made and handed to you. Only then can the next person order.
* **Asynchronous (With `@Async`):** You place your order, and the cashier gives you a pager (`CompletableFuture`). You are now free to go find a seat and wait. The barista (a background thread) makes your coffee. When it's ready, your pager buzzes, and you collect your coffee. The cashier was free to serve other customers immediately after taking your order.

`@Async` frees up the "cashier" (the main web server thread) to handle other incoming requests while the "barista" (a background thread pool) works on the heavy task.

#### How to Enable and Use `@Async`

1. **Enable Asynchronous Processing:** Add the `@EnableAsync` annotation to one of your `@Configuration` classes.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AppConfig {
    // ... other configurations
}
```

2. **Annotate the Method:** Add `@Async` to any `public` method that you want to run in the background.

#### Return Types for `@Async` Methods (IMP)

* **`void`**: For "fire and forget" tasks. The caller does not wait for the method to complete and cannot get a result or handle exceptions from it.

```java
@Async
public void sendEmailNotification(String message) {
    // ... logic to send an email, the caller moves on immediately
}
```

**Common Pitfall**: Exceptions thrown in a `void` async method are not propagated to the caller and will be lost unless you configure a custom `AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler`.
* **`Future<T>`** or **`CompletableFuture<T>`**: For tasks that will eventually produce a result. The caller receives a `Future` object immediately, which acts as a placeholder for the result. The caller can then choose to wait for the result later.
  * **Best Practice**: **Always prefer `CompletableFuture`** (introduced in Java 8). It's more powerful and flexible than the older `Future`, offering a rich API for composing, combining, and handling asynchronous operations in a non-blocking way.

```java
@Service
public class DataProcessingService {

    @Async
    public CompletableFuture<ProcessedData> processLargeFile(File file) throws InterruptedException {
        // Simulate a long-running process
        Thread.sleep(5000L);
        ProcessedData result = new ProcessedData("Processed: " + file.getName());
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(result);
    }
}
```


#### Configuring the Thread Pool (IMP)

By default, Spring Boot uses a `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor`, which creates a **new thread for every task**. This is dangerous in production as it can quickly exhaust system resources.

**Best Practice:** Always define your own `TaskExecutor` bean to configure a bounded thread pool.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AsyncConfig {

    @Bean(name = "taskExecutor")
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(5);   // Number of threads to keep in the pool
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(10);   // Maximum number of threads allowed
        executor.setQueueCapacity(25); // Number of tasks to queue before rejecting
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("Async-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```

You can then tell an `@Async` method to use this specific executor: `@Async("taskExecutor")`.

#### Rules and Common Pitfalls (IMP)

`@Async` works using AOP proxies, just like `@Transactional`. This leads to the same set of rules:

1. **Must be on a `public` method:** The proxy cannot intercept non-public method calls.
2. **Self-Invocation Does Not Work:** Calling an `@Async` method from another method within the same class (`this.asyncMethod()`) will **bypass the proxy**. The call will be a direct Java method call and will execute **synchronously** in the same thread.
  * **Solution**: The `@Async` method must be in a separate Spring bean and called from the outside.

**Incorrect Usage (Self-Invocation):**

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Async
    public void myAsyncMethod() {
        // This will run in a background thread
    }

    public void triggerAsync() {
        // WRONG: This call is synchronous because it bypasses the Spring proxy
        this.myAsyncMethod();
    }
}
```

**Correct Usage:**

```java
// Caller class
@Service
public class OrchestratorService {
    @Autowired
    private AsyncWorkerService asyncWorkerService;

    public void doWork() {
        // CORRECT: Calling the async method from another bean works as expected
        asyncWorkerService.myAsyncMethod();
    }
}

// Separate bean with the async method
@Service
public class AsyncWorkerService {
    @Async
    public void myAsyncMethod() {
        // This will run in a background thread
    }
}
```

  <summary>09: Interceptors</summary>

### Section 9: Interceptors

In Spring MVC, an **Interceptor** (specifically, a `HandlerInterceptor`) is a powerful component that allows you to intercept incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses. It provides hooks into the request processing lifecycle, enabling you to execute code **before** the controller handler is invoked, **after** it has completed, and **after** the view is rendered.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
An interceptor is like a security checkpoint at an airport before you board your flight (the controller handler).

1. **`preHandle` (Before Security Check):** You present your boarding pass and ID to the security agent. The agent can check if your documents are valid and if you are on the correct flight list. If not, they can **deny you entry** right there, and you never even get to the gate. This is the `preHandle` method, which can stop the request from reaching the controller.
2. **`postHandle` (At the Gate):** After your flight has landed but before you exit the airport, gate staff might hand you a customs form or a welcome brochure. This happens *after* your main journey (the controller logic) is complete but *before* you've officially left the airport (the view is rendered). This is the `postHandle` method.
3. **`afterCompletion` (Exiting the Airport):** Once you have passed baggage claim and are leaving the airport, cleaning crews come in to clean the gate area. This cleanup happens regardless of whether your flight was smooth or delayed (successful request or exception). This is the `afterCompletion` method, which is always called for cleanup tasks.

#### The `HandlerInterceptor` Interface (IMP)

To create an interceptor, you implement the `HandlerInterceptor` interface, which has three default methods:

* **`preHandle(request, response, handler)`**:
  * Executed **before** the target controller's handler method is called.
  * **Crucial Feature (IMP):** This method returns a `boolean`.
    * If it returns `true`, the request processing continues to the handler method.
    * If it returns `false`, the request is halted, and the handler method is **not** executed. This is extremely useful for things like authentication checks.
  * You can modify the request or response here.
* **`postHandle(request, response, handler, modelAndView)`**:
  * Executed **after** the handler method has been invoked but **before** the view is rendered.
  * It allows you to modify the `ModelAndView` object, such as adding extra attributes to the model that will be accessible in the view.
  * **Common Pitfall**: This method is **not** called if the `preHandle` method returned `false` or if an exception was thrown in the handler.
* **`afterCompletion(request, response, handler, ex)`**:
  * Executed **after** the complete request has finished and the view has been rendered.
  * It's always called, even if an exception occurred. This makes it ideal for **cleanup operations**, like releasing resources or calculating total request processing time.
  * The `ex` parameter contains the exception if one was thrown during processing.


#### How to Implement and Register an Interceptor

**Step 1: Create the Interceptor Class**

Create a class that implements `HandlerInterceptor` (or extends `HandlerInterceptorAdapter` in older Spring versions).

```java
@Component
public class LoggingInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggingInterceptor.class);

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        request.setAttribute("startTime", startTime);
        logger.info("Request URL::{} | Start Time::{}", request.getRequestURL(), System.currentTimeMillis());
        return true; // Continue with the execution chain
    }

    @Override
    public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
        logger.info("Request URL::{} | Sent to Handler :: Current Time::{}", request.getRequestURL(), System.currentTimeMillis());
        // Can add common attributes to the model here
    }

    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex) throws Exception {
        long startTime = (Long) request.getAttribute("startTime");
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long executionTime = endTime - startTime;
        logger.info("Request URL::{} | End Time::{} | Total Time Taken::{}ms", request.getRequestURL(), endTime, executionTime);
        if (ex != null) {
            logger.error("Request resulted in an exception: {}", ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Register the Interceptor (IMP)**

You must register your interceptor with Spring's `InterceptorRegistry`. This is done by implementing the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface in a `@Configuration` class.

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Autowired
    private LoggingInterceptor loggingInterceptor;

    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        // Register the interceptor and specify which URL patterns it should apply to.
        registry.addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor)
                .addPathPatterns("/api/**") // Apply to all paths under /api/
                .excludePathPatterns("/api/public/**"); // Exclude specific paths
    }
}
```

**Best Practice:** Use `addPathPatterns` and `excludePathPatterns` to precisely control which endpoints your interceptor should monitor. Applying an interceptor globally (`/**`) can have unintended performance consequences.

#### Common Use Cases for Interceptors

* **Logging**: Logging request details, response status, and execution time.
* **Authentication \& Authorization**: Checking for a valid JWT token or user session in `preHandle` and stopping the request if invalid.
* **Auditing**: Recording information about who made a request and what they did.
* **Locale and Theme Resolution**: Setting the user's locale based on a request parameter or header.

  <summary>10: Custom Interceptors</summary>

### Section 10: Custom Interceptors

A "custom interceptor" is not a special type of interceptor; it is simply a practical implementation of Spring's `HandlerInterceptor` interface tailored to a specific, application-defined need. The previous section explained the theory of interceptors. This section demonstrates how to build a custom one for a very common and interview-relevant use case: API key authentication.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
Think back to the airport security checkpoint (`HandlerInterceptor`). A **custom interceptor** is like training a security agent for a specific, non-standard task. For example, a "VIP Lounge Access" agent. Their job is not just to check the standard boarding pass, but to look for a special "VIP Pass" (`X-API-KEY`) in a passenger's documents.

* If the VIP pass is present and valid, they allow the passenger to proceed.
* If it's missing or invalid, they deny access immediately (`preHandle` returns `false`), and the passenger never reaches the gate.

This specialized check is your custom logic.

#### Use Case: API Key Authentication Interceptor

Let's build an interceptor that protects certain endpoints by requiring a valid API key in the request header.

**Goal:**

* For requests to protected endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/**`), check for a header named `X-API-KEY`.
* If the header is missing or its value is incorrect, block the request and return an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` status.
* If the key is valid, allow the request to proceed to the controller.


#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1: Define the API Key in `application.properties`**

**Best Practice:** Never hardcode secrets like API keys. Externalize them to your configuration files.

```properties
# application.properties
app.security.api-key=SECRET_KEY_12345
```

**Step 2: Create the Custom Interceptor Class (IMP)**

This class contains the core authentication logic. It injects the configured API key and implements the `preHandle` method to perform the check.

```java
@Component
public class ApiKeyAuthInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Value("${app.security.api-key}")
    private String configuredApiKey;

    private static final String API_KEY_HEADER = "X-API-KEY";

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
        // 1. Get the API key from the request header
        String requestApiKey = request.getHeader(API_KEY_HEADER);

        // 2. Check if the key is present and valid
        if (requestApiKey == null || !requestApiKey.equals(configuredApiKey)) {
            // 3. If invalid, set the response status and return false to block the request
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED);
            response.getWriter().write("Error: Invalid or Missing API Key");

            // Common Pitfall: Forgetting to return false. If you return true,
            // the request will proceed to the controller even after you've set an error status.
            return false;
        }

        // 4. If valid, return true to allow the request to continue to the controller
        return true;
    }

    // postHandle and afterCompletion can be left with their default implementations
    // as they are not needed for this specific authentication logic.
}
```

**Step 3: Register the Custom Interceptor (IMP)**

Just like any other interceptor, you must register it and specify the URL patterns it should protect.

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Autowired
    private ApiKeyAuthInterceptor apiKeyAuthInterceptor;

    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        // Apply the API key interceptor only to the protected V1 API endpoints
        registry.addInterceptor(apiKeyAuthInterceptor)
                .addPathPatterns("/api/v1/**")
                .excludePathPatterns("/api/v1/public/**"); // Example: excluding a public sub-path
    }
}
```

With this setup:

* A request to `GET /api/v1/users` without a valid `X-API-KEY` header will be rejected with a `401` error.
* A request to `GET /api/v1/public/status` will be allowed without an API key.
* A request to `GET /api/v2/products` will also be allowed, as it doesn't match the `/api/v1/**` pattern.

This approach provides a clean and reusable way to secure parts of your API without cluttering your controller methods with authentication boilerplate.

  <summary>11: Filters vs Interceptors</summary>

### Section 11: Filters vs. Interceptors

This is a classic Spring interview question. Both Filters and Interceptors are used to intercept requests and responses, but they operate at different levels of the application stack and have different capabilities and use cases.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
Imagine entering a large, secure corporate building.

* **Filter (Building Security at the Main Entrance):** This is the first point of contact. The security guards here don't know or care which department you're visiting (`Controller`). Their job is to perform broad checks on everyone who enters the building. They check for things like a valid ID badge, scan for dangerous items (request body manipulation), or log every single person entering and leaving the building (request/response logging). They are part of the building's infrastructure (`Servlet Container`), not a specific department (`DispatcherServlet`).
* **Interceptor (Department Receptionist):** Once you're inside the building and go to a specific floor (e.g., the "Finance" department), you meet the department receptionist. This receptionist is part of the "Finance" department's workflow (`DispatcherServlet`). They know about the department's specific rules, meeting schedules (`Handler`), and who you are supposed to meet (`Controller`). They can check if you have an appointment (`preHandle`), give you specific forms to fill out (`postHandle`), and log your visit in the department's visitor log (`afterCompletion`).


#### Comparison Table (IMP)

| Feature | Servlet Filter (`javax.servlet.Filter`) | Spring `HandlerInterceptor` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Origin** | Part of the **Servlet API** (Java EE standard). | Specific to the **Spring Framework**. |
| **Scope of Operation** | Operates at the **Servlet Container** level (e.g., Tomcat). It acts **before** the request reaches the `DispatcherServlet`. | Operates **within** the Spring MVC framework, after the `DispatcherServlet` has received the request. |
| **Awareness** | **Not aware** of the Spring context, controllers, or handlers. It only knows about `ServletRequest` and `ServletResponse`. | **Aware** of the Spring context, including the handler (`Controller` method) that will process the request and the `ModelAndView` object. |
| **Control Granularity** | Less fine-grained. It can only intercept the request and response. | **More fine-grained**. Provides three methods (`preHandle`, `postHandle`, `afterCompletion`) that hook into different stages of request processing. |
| **Key Use Cases** | - Logging all incoming requests and their sources.<br>- GZIP compression/decompression.<br>- Modifying the request or response body (e.g., content type, character encoding).<br>- Coarse-grained authentication (e.g., checking a session cookie before Spring Security takes over). | - Fine-grained authentication/authorization based on which handler will be executed.<br>- Modifying the `ModelAndView` before the view is rendered.<br>- Business logic-related logging (e.g., "User X is accessing handler Y").<br>- Auditing. |
| **Can it stop the chain?** | **Yes.** By not calling `chain.doFilter(request, response)`. | **Yes.** By returning `false` from the `preHandle` method. |
| **Can it modify the request/response?** | **Yes.** Can wrap the request/response objects to change their behavior. | **No.** Cannot modify the request/response body directly, but can modify headers and the `ModelAndView` in `postHandle`. |

#### Visual Representation

```
HTTP Request -> Container (Tomcat) -> Filter 1 -> Filter 2 -> [ Spring's DispatcherServlet ] -> Interceptor 1 (pre) -> Interceptor 2 (pre) -> Controller -> Interceptor 2 (post) -> Interceptor 1 (post) -> View Rendering -> Interceptor 2 (after) -> Interceptor 1 (after) -> [ DispatcherServlet ] -> Filter 2 -> Filter 1 -> Container -> HTTP Response
```


#### When to Use Which? (IMP)

* **Use a `Filter` for:**
  * Cross-cutting concerns that are not specific to Spring, such as manipulating the raw HTTP request/response.
  * Tasks that must happen before the request even enters the Spring MVC pipeline.
  * **Examples**: Handling multipart form data, setting character encoding, compressing responses with GZIP, or implementing a basic CORS policy.
* **Use an `Interceptor` for:**
  * Logic that needs access to the Spring `ApplicationContext` or information about the target controller method (`HandlerMethod`).
  * Implementing business-level security checks, such as role-based access to specific controllers.
  * Adding common model attributes for all responses from a group of controllers.
  * **Examples**: API key validation for `/api/**` paths, logging which user is calling which controller method, or checking for a "Maintenance Mode" flag before allowing a request to proceed.

**Best Practice:** If your logic is tightly coupled with the Spring MVC workflow and needs information about which controller is being invoked, an **Interceptor** is almost always the right choice. If your logic is purely about the raw HTTP request and response and is framework-agnostic, a **Filter** is more appropriate.

  <summary>12: HATEOAS API</summary>

### Section 12: HATEOAS API

**HATEOAS** stands for **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State**. It is a constraint of the REST application architecture and is considered the highest level of maturity for a REST API (Level 3 in the Richardson Maturity Model).

The core idea is that a client interacting with a REST API should not need prior knowledge of all the specific URIs to navigate the application. Instead, the response for a resource should contain hypermedia links that guide the client on what actions they can perform next.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
A HATEOAS-compliant API works just like you browse a website.

* **Without HATEOAS:** You are given a book with a table of contents. To go from chapter 1 to chapter 5, you must look up the page number for chapter 5 in the table of contents (hardcoded URI knowledge).
* **With HATEOAS:** You are reading a webpage (a resource response). At the bottom of the page, there are hyperlinks for "Next Page," "Previous Page," and "Back to Home." You don't need to know the URLs for these pages beforehand; you **discover** them from the current page. The API response itself tells you what you can do next.

This makes the client and server much more **loosely coupled**. If the server changes the URI for "all users" from `/users` to `/api/v2/users`, a non-HATEOAS client will break. A HATEOAS client will simply follow the link provided in the response and continue to work seamlessly.

#### Implementing HATEOAS in Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides excellent support for HATEOAS via the `spring-boot-starter-hateoas` dependency.

1. **Add the dependency:**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-hateoas</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. **Use `EntityModel` and `CollectionModel`:**
  * **`EntityModel<T>`**: A wrapper for a single resource object that adds a `_links` section.
  * **`CollectionModel<T>`**: A wrapper for a collection of resources.

#### Code Example: Before and After HATEOAS (IMP)

Let's transform a standard `UserController` to be HATEOAS-compliant.

**Controller WITHOUT HATEOAS:**
The response is just raw data. The client has to know that to get all users, they must call `GET /users`.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable long id) {
        // ... find user by id
        return user; // Returns a plain User object
    }
}
```

**JSON Response:**

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe"
}
```

**Controller WITH HATEOAS:**
The response includes the data *and* links to related actions.

**Step A: Update the DTO to extend `RepresentationModel`** (optional but good practice).

```java
// This base class provides the add(Link link) method.
public class User extends RepresentationModel<User> {
    private long id;
    private String name;
    // getters and setters
}
```

**Step B: Update the Controller Method (IMP)**
Use `WebMvcLinkBuilder` to create links in a type-safe way, avoiding hardcoded URIs.

```java
import static org.springframework.hateoas.server.mvc.WebMvcLinkBuilder.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public EntityModel<User> getUserById(@PathVariable long id) {
        User user = // ... find user by id

        // Create a link to the user itself ("self" link) - THIS IS CRUCIAL
        Link selfLink = linkTo(methodOn(UserController.class).getUserById(id)).withSelfRel();

        // Create a link to the "all users" endpoint
        Link allUsersLink = linkTo(methodOn(UserController.class).getAllUsers()).withRel("all-users");

        // Wrap the user object in an EntityModel and add the links
        return EntityModel.of(user, selfLink, allUsersLink);
    }

    @GetMapping
    public CollectionModel<EntityModel<User>> getAllUsers() {
        // ... logic to fetch all users
        // ... loop through users and add self-links to each
        // ... return a CollectionModel
    }
}
```

**JSON Response (Now with Links):**

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/users/1"
        },
        "all-users": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/users"
        }
    }
}
```

**Best Practices \& Common Pitfalls:**

* **`linkTo(methodOn(...))` (IMP):** This is the standard, type-safe way to build links. It links directly to the controller method, so if you refactor the method's path, the link automatically updates. **Avoid hardcoding URIs.**
* **The "self" Link:** Always include a `self` link so the client can easily retrieve the canonical URI for the resource it's looking at.
* **IANA Link Relations:** Use standard link relation types (like `self`, `next`, `prev`, `collection`) where possible. For custom actions, use descriptive names like `all-users`.

HATEOAS leads to more discoverable, robust, and maintainable APIs, which is a hallmark of a truly RESTful service.

  <summary>13: JPA</summary>

### Section 13: JPA (Java Persistence API)

**JPA** is a Java specification that provides a standard way to map Java objects to relational database tables. This is known as **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**. JPA itself is just an API (a set of interfaces and annotations); it requires an implementation to work. The most popular implementation is **Hibernate**, which Spring Boot uses by default.

**Spring Data JPA** is a project under the Spring umbrella that makes it even easier to implement JPA-based repositories. It provides a `JpaRepository` interface that, when extended, automatically provides a full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods, eliminating nearly all boilerplate code for data access.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**

* **JDBC (Low-level):** You are a translator who has to manually translate every single sentence from English to French and back. It's tedious, error-prone, and you need to know both languages perfectly.
* **JPA/Hibernate (ORM):** You are given a magical, universal translator device (Hibernate). You speak English into it (call methods on a Java object), and it automatically speaks French to the database (generates SQL). You don't need to know the fine details of SQL dialects.
* **Spring Data JPA (Repository):** The universal translator device is now voice-activated (`JpaRepository`). You don't even have to press buttons. You just say "Find user by name," and it automatically understands and performs the translation and query.


#### Core Components

1. **`@Entity` (IMP):** An annotation that marks a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) as a JPA entity, meaning it will be mapped to a table in the database.
  * **Requirements:**
    * It must have a no-argument constructor.
    * It must have a primary key, annotated with `@Id`.
2. **`@Id` and `@GeneratedValue`:**
  * `@Id`: Specifies the primary key of an entity.
  * `@GeneratedValue`: Configures how the primary key value is generated.
    * `strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY`: Lets the database generate the ID (e.g., auto-increment column). **Most common for MySQL.**
    * `strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE`: Uses a database sequence to generate the ID. **Most common for PostgreSQL and Oracle.**
    * `strategy = GenerationType.AUTO`: (Default) The persistence provider chooses the strategy.
3. **`JpaRepository<T, ID>` (IMP):** The core interface of Spring Data JPA. By creating an interface that extends it, you get a wealth of persistence methods for free.
  * `T`: The entity type (e.g., `User`).
  * `ID`: The type of the entity's primary key (e.g., `Long`).

#### Code Example: Creating an Entity and Repository

**Step 1: Add the dependencies**
You need `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` and a database driver (e.g., `h2`, `postgresql`).

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

**Step 2: Create the `@Entity` class**

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users") // Optional: specifies the table name
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "user_name", nullable = false, unique = true)
    private String username;

    private String email;

    // A no-argument constructor is required by JPA
    public User() {}

    // Getters and setters...
}
```

**Step 3: Create the Repository Interface**
This is all you need to get full CRUD functionality.

```java
@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // Spring Data JPA will automatically implement this method for you!
    Optional<User> findByUsername(String username);
}
```


#### Query Methods in Spring Data JPA

1. **Derived Query Methods (IMP):** This is the most powerful feature. Spring Data JPA automatically creates queries from method names in your repository interface. The method name is parsed, and keywords like `FindBy`, `And`, `Or`, `GreaterThan`, `Like`, etc., are used to construct a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query.

**Examples:**
* `List<User> findByEmail(String email);`
* `List<User> findByUsernameAndEmail(String username, String email);`
* `List<User> findByAgeGreaterThan(int age);`
* `long countByStatus(String status);`
2. **`@Query` Annotation:** For complex queries that cannot be expressed with method names, you can use the `@Query` annotation to provide a custom JPQL or native SQL query.

**JPQL Example:**

```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.email LIKE %?1%")
List<User> findByEmailDomain(String domain);
```

**Native SQL Example:**

```java
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email_address = :email", nativeQuery = true)
User findByEmailNative(@Param("email") String email);
```

**Best Practice:** Prefer JPQL over native SQL because it is database-independent and works directly with your entity model. Use native SQL only when you need to use database-specific features.

#### Relationships (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.)

JPA provides annotations to map relationships between entities.


| Annotation | Relationship | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`@ManyToOne`** | Many Posts to One User | The "many" side (e.g., `Post`) holds a foreign key to the "one" side (`User`). This is the owning side. |
| **`@OneToMany`** | One User to Many Posts | The "one" side (`User`) has a collection of the "many" side (`Post`). Use `mappedBy` here. |
| **`@OneToOne`** | One User to One Profile | One entity is associated with exactly one other entity. |
| **`@ManyToMany`** | Many Students to Many Courses | Requires a join table. Often complex and better modeled as two `@OneToMany` relationships with a join entity. |

**Common Pitfall: The N+1 Select Problem (IMP)**
This is a major performance anti-pattern.

* **Scenario:** You have a `User` with a `@OneToMany` relationship to `Post`. You fetch all users (`SELECT * FROM users` - 1 query). Then, you loop through the users and access their posts. If the posts are lazily loaded, this triggers a separate `SELECT` query for *each* user to fetch their posts (N queries). Total queries = 1 + N.
* **Solution:** Use a **`JOIN FETCH`** in a custom `@Query` or an **`@EntityGraph`** to tell JPA to fetch the related entities in a single query.

```java
// Solution with JOIN FETCH
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u JOIN FETCH u.posts")
List<User> findAllUsersWithPosts();
```

  <summary>14: Spring Security</summary>

### Section 14: Spring Security

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable framework that provides both authentication and authorization to Spring applications. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
Spring Security acts as the comprehensive security system for a high-security building.

* **Authentication (Who are you?):** This is the process of verifying your identity. It's like showing your ID card at the building's front desk. The guard (`AuthenticationManager`) checks your credentials (username/password) against a database of employees (`UserDetailsService`). If they match, you are given a temporary access badge (`Authentication` object), which proves you are who you say you are.
* **Authorization (What are you allowed to do?):** Once you're inside, this process determines what you can access. Your access badge might grant you entry to the general office floors but not the server room. The security system checks the permissions (`GrantedAuthority`) on your badge against the access rules for each door (`SecurityFilterChain`).


#### Core Components and Flow (IMP)

1. **`SecurityFilterChain`**: The heart of Spring Security. It's a chain of filters that intercepts incoming requests to perform security checks. You configure this chain to define your security rules.
2. **`Authentication`**: An object that represents the currently authenticated user. It contains:
  * **`Principal`**: The user's identity (often a `UserDetails` object).
  * **`Credentials`**: The proof of identity (e.g., password), which is usually cleared after authentication.
  * **`Authorities`**: A collection of `GrantedAuthority` objects representing the user's permissions (e.g., 'ROLE_ADMIN', 'READ_PRIVILEGE').
3. **`SecurityContextHolder`**: A thread-local storage utility that holds the `SecurityContext`, which in turn contains the `Authentication` object for the current user. You can access the current user's details anywhere via `SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication()`.
4. **`AuthenticationManager`**: The central component that processes an authentication request. It delegates to one or more `AuthenticationProvider`s.
5. **`AuthenticationProvider`**: Performs the actual authentication logic. A common implementation is `DaoAuthenticationProvider`, which uses a `UserDetailsService` and a `PasswordEncoder`.
6. **`UserDetailsService`**: An interface with a single method, `loadUserByUsername(String username)`. You implement this to tell Spring Security how to find a user by their username from your database, LDAP, or any other source.
7. **`UserDetails`**: An interface representing the core user information. Your `User` entity often implements this interface. It provides details like the username, password (hashed), authorities, and account status (e.g., enabled, locked).
8. **`PasswordEncoder`**: An interface for encoding (hashing) passwords.
  * **Best Practice (IMP):** **Always use `BCryptPasswordEncoder`**. It is the industry standard for securely hashing passwords with a salt. Never store passwords in plain text.

#### Configuration in Modern Spring Boot (Spring Boot 3+) (IMP)

Since Spring Security 5.7, the configuration has shifted to a component-based approach using a `SecurityFilterChain` bean, deprecating the older `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.

**Step 1: Add the dependency**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Step 2: Create the `SecurityFilterChain` bean**
This is where you define all your security rules.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableMethodSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.http.SessionCreationPolicy;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.web.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity // Enables method-level security with @PreAuthorize, etc.
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            // 1. Disable CSRF for stateless REST APIs (IMP)
            .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())

            // 2. Configure session management to be stateless for REST APIs
            .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))

            // 3. Define authorization rules
            .authorizeHttpRequests(authz -> authz
                .requestMatchers("/api/public/**", "/auth/login").permitAll() // Public endpoints
                .requestMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN") // Requires ADMIN role
                .requestMatchers("/api/users/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN") // Requires USER or ADMIN role
                .anyRequest().authenticated() // All other requests require authentication
            )

            // 5. For JWT-based authentication (very common for APIs)
            // Assumes you have a custom jwtAuthenticationFilter bean
            // .addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
            ;

        return http.build();
    }
}
```


#### Implementing `UserDetailsService`

You must provide a bean that implements `UserDetailsService` to connect Spring Security to your user data store.

```java
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UsernameNotFoundException;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class JpaUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {

    // Assume UserRepository is injected
    // @Autowired
    // private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        // Fetch user from your database and convert it to a UserDetails object
        // Example:
        // return userRepository.findByUsername(username)
        //         .map(SecurityUser::new) // Convert your User entity to a UserDetails implementation
        //         .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("Username not found: " + username));
        // For demonstration, returning a hardcoded user
        if ("user".equals(username)) {
            return org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User.withUsername("user")
                .password(passwordEncoder().encode("password"))
                .roles("USER").build();
        } else {
            throw new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found");
        }
    }
    
    // Assume passwordEncoder bean is available
    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```


#### Method-Level Security (IMP)

While the `SecurityFilterChain` handles URL-based security, method-level security provides more granular control directly on your service methods.

* **Enable it** with `@EnableMethodSecurity`.
* **`@PreAuthorize`**: The most powerful. Checks permissions **before** the method is executed. It uses Spring Expression Language (SpEL).
  * `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`
  * `@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'USER')")`
  * `@PreAuthorize("#username == authentication.principal.username")` (Allows a user to only access their own data).
* **`@PostAuthorize`**: Checks permissions **after** the method has executed, just before returning the result. Less common, used when the decision depends on the returned object.
* **`@Secured`**: JSR-250 standard annotation. Simpler than `@PreAuthorize`, only supports role names (e.g., `@Secured("ROLE_ADMIN")`).
* **`@RolesAllowed`**: Another JSR-250 annotation, similar to `@Secured`.

**Best Practice:** Use a combination of `SecurityFilterChain` for broad URL patterns and `@PreAuthorize` for fine-grained business rules on your service methods.

  <summary>15: Microservices</summary>

### Section 15: Microservices

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services, modeled around a business domain. Each service is self-contained, independently deployable, and communicates with other services over a network, typically via APIs.

#### Monolith vs. Microservices - Benefits \& Tradeoffs (IMP)

| Aspect | Monolithic Architecture | Microservices Architecture |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Development** | **Simpler \& Faster Initially:** A single codebase is easy to set up and develop in the early stages [^16_1][^16_2]. | **Complex Initially:** Requires setup for inter-service communication, discovery, and gateways [^16_3]. |
| **Scalability** | **Inefficient:** To scale one feature, you must scale the entire application, leading to wasted resources [^16_2]. | **Efficient \& Granular:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific load [^16_4][^16_2]. |
| **Technology Stack** | **Homogeneous:** Locked into a single technology stack for the entire application. | **Heterogeneous (Polyglot):** Each service can use the best technology stack for its specific job [^16_5]. |
| **Reliability** | **Fragile:** A failure in one module can bring down the entire application [^16_6]. | **Resilient:** A failure in one service can be isolated and is less likely to cause a catastrophic system failure [^16_5][^16_6]. |
| **Deployment** | **Infrequent \& High-Risk:** The entire application must be redeployed for any small change [^16_2]. | **Frequent \& Independent:** Services can be deployed independently, enabling faster iteration and CI/CD [^16_4]. |
| **Simplicity** | Simple to develop, test, and deploy in the beginning [^16_1]. | Becomes simpler to understand and maintain at a large scale as individual services are small and focused. |


***

### Inter-Service Communication

Services in a microservices architecture need to communicate with each other. The two most common synchronous communication patterns are:

1. **`RestClient` (Modern \& Programmatic)**
  * Introduced in Spring Framework 6, `RestClient` is the modern, fluent API for making synchronous HTTP requests. It is the intended replacement for `RestTemplate`.[^16_7]
  * **Example:**

```java
@Service
public class AddressClient {
    private final RestClient restClient;

    public AddressClient(RestClient.Builder builder) {
        this.restClient = builder.baseUrl("http://address-service").build();
    }

    public Address getAddress(Long employeeId) {
        return restClient.get()
                .uri("/api/addresses/{id}", employeeId)
                .retrieve()
                .body(Address.class);
    }
}
```

2. **`FeignClient` (Declarative \& Proxy-Based) (IMP)**
  * **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** provides a declarative way to create REST clients. You simply define an interface and annotate it, and Feign creates a proxy implementation at runtime. This is often preferred for its readability and simplicity.[^16_8][^16_9]
  * **Implementation:**

3. Add the `spring-cloud-starter-openfeign` dependency.
4. Enable it in your main application class with `@EnableFeignClients`.[^16_8]
5. Create an interface for the client.
```java
// The "name" attribute should match the service name in the discovery server
@FeignClient(name = "address-service")
public interface AddressClient {
    @GetMapping("/api/addresses/{id}")
    Address getAddressByEmployeeId(@PathVariable("id") Long id);
}
```


***

### Core Microservice Patterns

#### 1. Service Discovery (IMP)

In a dynamic environment, service instances can be added or removed, and their IP addresses can change. A **Service Registry** (or Discovery Server) is a central "phone book" where services register themselves upon startup and de-register upon shutdown.

* **How it works:** When Service A wants to call Service B, it first asks the Service Registry for a list of available instances of Service B.
* **Implementation:** **Netflix Eureka** is the classic choice provided by Spring Cloud.[^16_10]
  * Create a separate Spring Boot application with the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server` dependency.
  * Annotate the main class with `@EnableEurekaServer`.[^16_11]
  * Client services include `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` and register by setting `eureka.client.register-with-eureka=true`.


#### 2. Client-Side Load Balancer (IMP)

When the Service Registry returns multiple instances of a service, the client needs to decide which one to call. This is **client-side load balancing**.

* **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** integrates with the Service Registry to distribute requests among healthy service instances.[^16_12]
* It provides a round-robin policy by default but can be configured for other strategies.[^16_13]
* When using a `RestTemplate` or `RestClient`, annotating the bean with `@LoadBalanced` enables this functionality automatically.[^16_13]


#### 3. API Gateway (IMP)

An **API Gateway** is a single entry point for all external clients. It sits in front of all your microservices and handles routing, cross-cutting concerns, and security.

* **Benefits:**
  * **Encapsulation:** Hides the internal service architecture from the client.
  * **Centralized Concerns:** Handles authentication, SSL termination, rate limiting, and logging in one place.
  * **Routing:** Routes incoming requests to the appropriate downstream service.
* **Implementation:** **Spring Cloud Gateway** is the modern, non-blocking gateway built on Project Reactor. It uses routes and filters to manage traffic.[^16_11]

***

### Fault Tolerance \& Resilience Patterns (IMP)

* **Retry Pattern**: Automatically re-issues a failed request to handle transient faults like temporary network glitches. It's crucial to use this with an **exponential backoff** strategy to avoid overwhelming a struggling service. **Spring Retry** provides `@Retryable` for declarative retries.[^16_14][^16_15][^16_16]
* **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents an application from repeatedly trying to call a service that is known to be failing. It works like an electrical circuit breaker:
  * **Closed**: Requests flow normally. If failures exceed a threshold, it trips.
  * **Open**: The breaker trips. All calls to the failing service fail immediately without even attempting a network call, preventing cascading failures. After a timeout, it moves to half-open.
  * **Half-Open**: Allows a limited number of test requests. If they succeed, the breaker closes. If they fail, it opens again.
  * **Implementation**: Use libraries like **Resilience4j**.
* **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolates elements of an application into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function. For example, you can have separate thread pools for calls to different downstream services. This prevents a single misbehaving service from exhausting all resources and taking down the entire application.[^16_17][^16_18]
* **Rate Limiter**: Protects your services from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic. It throttles client requests, ensuring the service remains stable. Implementations include **Resilience4j** and **Bucket4j**.[^16_19]

***

### Observability \& Deployment

* **Distributed Tracing (IMP)**: In a microservices architecture, a single request can span multiple services. Distributed tracing assigns a unique **Trace ID** to each request, which is propagated across all service calls, allowing you to visualize the entire request flow and pinpoint bottlenecks or errors.
  * **Spring Boot 3+ Note:** Spring Cloud Sleuth has been **deprecated**. The modern approach is to use **Micrometer Tracing** with an OpenTelemetry (OTEL) exporter, which sends traces to backends like **Zipkin** or Jaeger.
* **Dockerizing Spring Boot Apps**: Packaging your application into a lightweight, portable Docker container is standard practice. Spring Boot's layered JARs are optimized for creating efficient Docker images by separating dependencies from application code.
* **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes (K8s) is the industry standard for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications like your Dockerized Spring Boot services.

  <summary>16: Actuator and Monitoring</summary>

### Section 16: Actuator and Monitoring

Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of Spring Boot that provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application. It does this by exposing a series of built-in endpoints over HTTP or JMX.

**Real-life Analogy (IMP):**
An Actuator is like the dashboard of your car. While your car's main purpose is to drive (your business logic), the dashboard provides critical information about its internal state:

* **Speedometer (`/metrics`):** Shows real-time performance data.
* **Check Engine Light (`/health`):** Tells you if the car is healthy or if a component (like the database or an external service) is down.
* **Fuel Gauge (`/metrics` with `disk.free`):** Shows resource levels like disk space.
* **Odometer (`/metrics` with `http.server.requests`):** Tracks usage statistics.
* **Owner's Manual (`/info`):** Provides general information about the car model.

Without this dashboard, you'd be "driving blind" in a production environment.

#### Commonly Used Actuator Endpoints (IMP)

By default, Actuator provides numerous endpoints, but for security reasons, only `/health` and `/info` are exposed over the web in modern Spring Boot versions.


| Endpoint ID | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **`/health`** | Shows application health information. Aggregates status from multiple `HealthIndicator`s (e.g., database, disk space) [^17_1]. |
| **`/metrics`** | Displays a wide range of application metrics, such as JVM memory usage, CPU usage, and HTTP request counts . |
| **`/info`** | Shows arbitrary application info. You can expose Git commit details, build versions, etc. [^17_1]. |
| **`/env`** | Exposes all properties from Spring's `Environment` (system properties, application properties, etc.). **Sensitive.** [^17_2] |
| **`/loggers`** | Allows you to view and modify the logging levels of your application at runtime [^17_1]. |
| **`/beans`** | Displays a complete list of all Spring beans configured in your application [^17_1]. |
| **`/mappings`** | Shows a collated list of all `@RequestMapping` paths in your application [^17_1]. |
| **`/httptrace`** | Displays HTTP trace information for the last 100 requests (method, path, status, time). |

#### Exposing and Securing Endpoints

* **Exposing Endpoints (IMP):** To expose more endpoints, you must configure them in `application.properties`.

```properties
# Expose only health, info, and metrics
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics

# Expose all endpoints (use with caution!)
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

# Expose all but exclude the specified ones
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=env,beans
```

* **Securing Endpoints (IMP):** Since endpoints like `/env` can leak secrets, it's crucial to secure them. This is typically done with Spring Security.
  **Best Practice:** Allow public access only to non-sensitive endpoints like `/health` and require an authenticated user with a specific role (e.g., `ACTUATOR_ADMIN`) for all others.

```java
// In your SecurityFilterChain configuration
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeHttpRequests(authz -> authz
        .requestMatchers("/actuator/health", "/actuator/info").permitAll() // Allow public access
        .requestMatchers("/actuator/**").hasRole("ACTUATOR_ADMIN") // Secure all others
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
    );
    // ... other configurations
    return http.build();
}
```


#### Custom Health Indicators (IMP)

The `/health` endpoint's power comes from its composite nature. You can add your own health checks by creating a bean that implements the `HealthIndicator` interface.

**Use Case:** Checking the health of a downstream microservice or an external payment gateway.

```java
@Component
public class DownstreamServiceHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {

    @Override
    public Health health() {
        if (isServiceHealthy()) {
            return Health.up().withDetail("service", "Service is available").build();
        } else {
            return Health.down().withDetail("service", "Service is unavailable").build();
        }
    }

    private boolean isServiceHealthy() {
        // Logic to ping the downstream service
        // e.g., make a lightweight API call
        return true; // or false
    }
}
```


#### Integration with Prometheus \& Grafana (IMP)

This is the most popular open-source solution for metrics collection and visualization.

1. **Add Dependency:** Add `micrometer-registry-prometheus` to your project.
2. **Expose Endpoint:** Spring Boot will automatically configure a `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint. Make sure to expose it via the `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` property.[^17_3]
3. **Scrape Metrics:** Configure your Prometheus server to "scrape" (poll) this endpoint periodically to collect the metrics.[^17_4]
4. **Visualize:** In Grafana, add Prometheus as a data source and build dashboards to visualize the metrics (e.g., CPU usage over time, HTTP request latency).

#### Custom Actuator Endpoints

If the built-in endpoints aren't enough, you can create your own for application-specific operations.

* `@Endpoint(id = "...")`: Marks a class as a custom actuator endpoint.
* `@ReadOperation`, `@WriteOperation`, `@DeleteOperation`: Annotations for methods within the endpoint class that map to GET, POST, and DELETE HTTP methods respectively.[^17_5]

```java
@Component
@Endpoint(id = "features")
public class FeatureFlagsEndpoint {

    @ReadOperation
    public Map<String, Boolean> getFeatureFlags() {
        // Return a map of currently enabled feature flags
        Map<String, Boolean> features = new HashMap<>();
        features.put("new-checkout-flow", true);
        return features;
    }
}
```

Accessing `GET /actuator/features` would now execute this method.

#### Integration with Third-Party APM Tools

For more comprehensive, all-in-one monitoring, many teams use commercial **Application Performance Management (APM)** tools like **Datadog** or **New Relic**. These tools typically use a Java agent that you attach to your application at startup. The agent automatically instruments your code to collect detailed metrics, distributed traces, and logs, providing deep insights into application performance with minimal configuration.[^17_6][^17_7]

  <summary>17: Event-Driven Architecture</summary>

### Section 17: Event-Driven Architecture \& Messaging

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design pattern where services communicate asynchronously through the production and consumption of events. This decouples services, allowing them to scale and evolve independently, which improves the overall resilience and flexibility of the system.

#### 1. Spring Application Events (In-Memory Messaging)

This is the simplest form of event-driven programming, used for communication **within a single Spring application**.

**Real-life Analogy:** A Spring application event is like an internal office memo. When the HR department (`Publisher`) hires a new employee (`Event`), they post a memo on the company noticeboard. The IT and Facilities departments (`Listeners`), who are subscribed to these notices, see the memo and independently start their processes (provisioning a laptop, assigning a desk) without HR having to tell them directly.

* **`ApplicationEventPublisher`**: The interface used to publish events.
* **Creating an Event**: Since Spring 4.2, any POJO can be an event. You no longer need to extend `ApplicationEvent`.[^18_1]

```java
// A simple POJO event
public record OrderPlacedEvent(Long orderId) {}
```

* **Publishing an Event**: Inject `ApplicationEventPublisher` and call `publishEvent()`.

```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;
    // constructor injection

    public void placeOrder() {
        // ... logic to save order
        publisher.publishEvent(new OrderPlacedEvent(order.getId()));
    }
}
```

* **Listening for an Event**: Create a method and annotate it with `@EventListener`.[^18_2]

```java
@Component
public class NotificationService {
    @EventListener
    public void handleOrderPlacedEvent(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
        // ... send an email or SMS notification
    }
}
```

    * **Best Practice:** For events tied to database transactions, use `@TransactionalEventListener`. This gives you control over when the event is sent (e.g., only after the transaction successfully commits).


#### 2. Apache Kafka with Spring Boot (IMP)

For communication **between different microservices**, you need a message broker like Apache Kafka. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that acts as a central nervous system for events.

* **Core Concepts:**
  * **Producer:** A service that sends messages (events) to a topic.[^18_3]
  * **Consumer:** A service that subscribes to a topic to read and process messages.[^18_3]
  * **Topic:** A named channel where messages are stored.[^18_3]
  * **Broker:** A Kafka server that manages topics and partitions.[^18_3]
* **Integration:** Use the `spring-kafka` dependency.
* **Producing Messages:** Use `KafkaTemplate`.

```java
@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, OrderPlacedEvent> kafkaTemplate;

public void publishOrderEvent(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
    kafkaTemplate.send("order-topic", event);
}
```

* **Consuming Messages:** Use the `@KafkaListener` annotation.

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-topic", groupId = "notification-group")
public void listen(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
    // ... process the event from another microservice
}
```


#### 3. Messaging Error Handling (IMP)

This is a critical topic in interviews. Errors can occur at two main stages:

**Stage 1: Deserialization Error**
This happens if the consumer receives a message it cannot convert into a Java object (e.g., a "poison pill" message with a bad format). This error occurs *before* your `@KafkaListener` code is even called.

* **Problem:** By default, this will cause the consumer to get stuck in an infinite loop, continuously failing to read the same message.
* **Solution:** Use the **`ErrorHandlingDeserializer`**. You configure your consumer to use this deserializer, which wraps your actual value deserializer.[^18_4]
  * When the delegate fails, `ErrorHandlingDeserializer` catches the exception and returns `null`. The container's error handler is then invoked with the failed record, allowing for custom logic like sending it to a Dead Letter Queue.[^18_4]

**Stage 2: Listener Execution Error**
This happens if an exception is thrown *inside* your `@KafkaListener` method (e.g., a database is down).

* **Retry Logic:** For transient errors, you should retry the operation. Spring Kafka provides a powerful `DefaultErrorHandler` for this.
  * **Best Practice:** Configure an error handler with a limited number of retries and an exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming a struggling downstream system.

```java
@Bean
public DefaultErrorHandler errorHandler() {
    // Retry 3 times with a 2-second delay between attempts
    return new DefaultErrorHandler(new FixedBackOff(2000L, 3L));
}
```

* **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Handling:** If a message fails all retry attempts, it should be moved to a DLQ. This is a separate Kafka topic where failed messages are stored for later analysis or manual reprocessing, preventing them from blocking the main topic.
  * **Implementation:** The `DefaultErrorHandler` can be configured to automatically publish failed records to a DLQ topic.

```java
@Bean
public DefaultErrorHandler errorHandler(KafkaTemplate<String, Object> template) {
    // After 3 failed attempts, send the message to the "orders.DLT" topic
    DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer recoverer = new DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer(template);
    return new DefaultErrorHandler(recoverer, new FixedBackOff(1000L, 2));
}
```


#### 4. Spring Integration Awareness

* **What it is:** A mature framework for building complex, message-driven workflows based on established Enterprise Integration Patterns.[^18_5]
* **How it relates to Kafka:** `spring-kafka` provides direct, relatively low-level integration. **Spring Integration** provides a higher level of abstraction. It uses concepts like Channels, Transformers, Routers, and Adapters to build a processing pipeline. It can use Kafka as one of its underlying messaging channels.
* **When to use:** For simple publish/subscribe, `spring-kafka` is usually enough. For complex workflows involving routing, message transformation, and orchestrating multiple systems, Spring Integration is the more powerful tool.


#### 5. Kafka Streams

* **What it is:** A client library for building stateful stream-processing applications. It's not just about consuming messages; it's about processing continuous streams of data in real-time.
* **Use Cases:** Real-time analytics, fraud detection, and creating materialized views from event streams.
* **Kafka Consumer vs. Kafka Streams:** A consumer processes one message at a time. A Kafka Streams application defines a topology to perform complex operations like `filter`, `map`, `join` between streams, and windowed `aggregations` (e.g., "calculate the total sales per category over the last 5 minutes").
* **Spring Boot Integration:** Add the `kafka-streams` dependency and use `@EnableKafkaStreams`. You then define your processing logic using a `StreamsBuilder` bean.

  <summary>18: Modularization & Architecture</summary>

### Section 18: Modularization \& Architecture

How you structure your application's code is critical for its long-term maintainability, scalability, and testability. As an application grows, a well-defined architecture prevents it from becoming a "Big Ball of Mud."

#### 1. Layered Architecture: Controller - Service - Repository (IMP)

This is the most common architectural pattern for Spring Boot applications. It separates the application into three distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility.

* **Controller/Presentation Layer:** Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and returning an HTTP response. It acts as the entry point to the application. It should contain minimal logic, primarily delegating work to the service layer.
* **Service/Business Layer:** Contains the core business logic of the application. It orchestrates calls to repositories and other services to fulfill a business use case. This is where transactions are typically managed.
* **Repository/Data Access Layer:** Responsible for all data access and persistence logic. It communicates with the database and encapsulates the details of how data is stored and retrieved.

**Analogy:** A restaurant.

* **Controller:** The waiter who takes your order (HTTP request).
* **Service:** The chef who takes the order, cooks the food (business logic), and assembles the plate.
* **Repository:** The pantry and refrigerator where the chef gets the raw ingredients (data).


#### 2. Package Structure (IMP)

How you organize your classes into packages has a significant impact on navigability and modularity.

* **Packaging by Layer (Traditional):** All controllers are in a `com.example.controller` package, all services in `com.example.service`, etc..[^19_1]
  * **Pros:** Easy to understand for simple projects.
  * **Cons:** Becomes very difficult to navigate in large applications. To work on a single feature (e.g., "Orders"), you have to jump between many different packages. It also encourages low cohesion, as unrelated features are mixed together.
* **Packaging by Feature (Recommended):** All classes related to a single feature are grouped into their own package (e.g., `com.example.order` contains `OrderController`, `OrderService`, and `OrderRepository`).
  * **Pros:**
    * **High Cohesion:** Related code lives together.
    * **Better Encapsulation:** You can use package-private visibility to hide implementation details of a feature from the rest of the application.
    * **Easier Navigation:** Finding all code related to a feature is simple.
    * Makes it easier to extract a feature into a microservice later.

| Packaging by Layer | Packaging by Feature |
| :-- | :-- |
| `com.app.controllers` <br> `com.app.services` <br> `com.app.repositories` | `com.app.orders` <br> `com.app.users` <br> `com.app.products` |

#### 3. Multi-Module Projects (Maven/Gradle)

For larger applications, a single module can become unwieldy. A multi-module project allows you to break down your application into several sub-projects (e.g., JARs) within a single build.

* **Benefits:**
  * Enforces clear boundaries and dependencies between parts of your application.
  * Improves build times by allowing parallel builds and only rebuilding changed modules.
  * Promotes code reuse by creating shared "library" or "common" modules.
* **Example Structure:**
  * `my-app-parent` (Root project with `pom.xml` or `settings.gradle`)
    * `my-app-api` (Contains DTOs and API interface definitions)
    * `my-app-domain` (Contains core business logic and entities)
    * `my-app-application` (The main executable Spring Boot application, depends on the others)
    * `my-app-infrastructure` (Contains implementations for databases, external clients, etc.)


#### 4. Advanced Architectural Concepts

* **Clean Architecture (IMP):** Popularized by Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob"), this architecture emphasizes the **Dependency Rule**: source code dependencies must always point inwards. The core business logic (Entities and Use Cases) at the center should have no knowledge of outer layers like databases, frameworks, or UIs. This makes the core logic highly portable and testable in isolation.[^19_2]
* **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):** A specific implementation of Clean Architecture. The "inside" (application core) communicates with the "outside" (UI, database, message queues) through "ports" (interfaces). The external components are "adapters" that implement these ports.[^19_2]
* **Modular Monolith vs. Microservices (IMP):**
  * A **Modular Monolith** is a monolith built with strong, well-defined module boundaries (like packaging-by-feature on steroids). Communication between modules is in-process (Java method calls).[^19_3]
  * **Benefits:** It gives you many of the organizational benefits of microservices (high cohesion, low coupling) without the massive operational overhead of a distributed system (deployment complexity, network latency, distributed transactions).[^19_4]
  * **Best Practice:** Many experts recommend starting with a well-structured modular monolith and only extracting modules into true microservices when there is a clear business need (e.g., independent scaling requirements).[^19_3]
* **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) (IMP):** A pattern from Domain-Driven Design (DDD). When your application needs to integrate with a legacy or external system that has a messy or undesirable data model, you create an ACL. This layer acts as a translator, converting the external model into a clean model that your application's core domain can work with. It protects your domain from being "corrupted" by foreign concepts.

  <summary>19: Performance, Caching and Tuning</summary>

### Section 19: Performance, Caching, and Tuning

Ensuring your Spring Boot application performs well under load is a critical engineering task. This involves tuning at multiple levels, from the JVM to your application code and database queries.

#### 1. JVM Tuning for Spring Boot Apps

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the foundation your application runs on. Proper tuning can significantly impact memory usage and responsiveness.[^20_1]

* **Heap Size (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`):** This is the most crucial setting.
  * `-Xms`: Sets the initial heap size.
  * `-Xmx`: Sets the maximum heap size.
  * **Best Practice:** In production, set `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to the **same value** (e.g., `java -Xms2g -Xmx2g -jar app.jar`). This prevents the JVM from wasting cycles resizing the heap during runtime.[^20_2]
* **Garbage Collector (GC) Tuning:** The GC is responsible for memory cleanup. Long GC pauses can freeze your application.
  * **G1GC (`-XX:+UseG1GC`):** The Garbage-First Garbage Collector is the modern default and is designed for low-pause, high-throughput applications. It's an excellent choice for most Spring Boot web services.[^20_3]


#### 2. Caching with Spring (IMP)

Caching is the most effective way to improve performance by storing the results of expensive operations (like database queries or API calls) and returning the cached result for subsequent identical requests.

* **Enable Caching:** Add `@EnableCaching` to a configuration class.[^20_4]
* **Core Caching Annotations:**

| Annotation | Purpose \& Behavior | Use Case |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`@Cacheable`** | **Read-through cache.** Before executing the method, Spring checks if a result exists in the cache for the given key. If yes, it returns the cached value without executing the method. If no, it executes the method, caches the result, and returns it . | Caching the result of a database query that rarely changes. |
| **`@CacheEvict`** | Removes data from the cache. Can evict a single entry or clear an entire cache (`allEntries = true`) [^20_5]. | When an item is updated or deleted, its entry must be removed from the cache to avoid stale data. |
| **`@CachePut`** | **Write-through cache.** Always executes the method and then **updates** the cache with the method's result. This is useful when you want to refresh a cache entry without interfering with the method execution . | Updating a user's profile and ensuring the new profile data is immediately available in the cache. |

**Code Example:**

```java
@Service
public class ProductService {

    @Cacheable(value = "products", key = "#id")
    public Product getProductById(String id) {
        // Simulates a slow database call
        return // ... logic to fetch product from DB
    }

    @CachePut(value = "products", key = "#product.id")
    public Product updateProduct(Product product) {
        // ... logic to update product in DB
        return product; // This return value updates the cache
    }

    @CacheEvict(value = "products", key = "#id")
    public void deleteProduct(String id) {
        // ... logic to delete product from DB
    }
}
```

* **Caching Providers (IMP):**
  * **Default:** Spring Boot uses a simple in-memory `ConcurrentHashMap` by default, which is not suitable for production or clustered environments.
  * **Caffeine:** A high-performance, in-memory caching library. It's an excellent replacement for the default cache in a single-node application.
  * **Redis:** A distributed, in-memory data store. Use Redis when you need a cache that is shared across multiple instances of your application (a distributed cache).


#### 3. Database Performance \& The N+1 Query Problem (IMP)

The **N+1 query problem** is a severe performance anti-pattern in ORM frameworks like JPA/Hibernate.[^20_6]

* **Scenario:** You have an `Author` entity with a list of `Book` entities (`@OneToMany`). You fetch 10 authors (1 query). Then, you loop through the authors and access their books. If `FetchType` is `LAZY`, Hibernate will execute a separate query for *each* author to get their books (N queries), resulting in a total of 1 + 10 = 11 queries.[^20_6]
* **Solutions:**

1. **`JOIN FETCH` in JPQL:** The best solution. Use a custom `@Query` to explicitly tell JPA to fetch the related collection in a single, efficient join.

```java
@Query("SELECT a FROM Author a JOIN FETCH a.books")
List<Author> findAllWithBooks();
```

2. **`@EntityGraph`:** A more dynamic way to specify which relationships to fetch eagerly for a specific query.
3. **`@BatchSize`:** An annotation you can place on a collection (`@OneToMany`) to tell Hibernate to fetch lazy collections in batches, reducing N queries to N/batch_size queries.[^20_7]


#### 4. Asynchronous I/O and Thread Pool Tuning

As discussed in Section 8, running tasks with `@Async` requires a properly configured thread pool.

* **Best Practice:** Never use the default executor. Define a `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` bean and configure its `corePoolSize`, `maxPoolSize`, and `queueCapacity` based on your workload and system resources.
* **Async Return Types:** For non-blocking operations, use `CompletableFuture` (for traditional applications) or `Mono`/`Flux` (for reactive applications with Spring WebFlux).


#### 5. Application Profiling

* **What it is:** Profiling is the process of analyzing an application's runtime behavior to identify performance bottlenecks. Profiling tools monitor CPU usage, memory allocation, thread activity, and method execution times.[^20_8]
* **When to use:**
  * Investigating high CPU usage to find inefficient methods.
  * Diagnosing high memory usage and finding memory leaks.
  * Pinpointing slow database queries.[^20_8]
* **Tools:** VisualVM (comes with the JDK), Java Flight Recorder (JFR), and commercial APM tools like New Relic or Datadog.


#### 6. Common Performance Anti-Patterns

* **Business Logic in Controllers:** Makes code hard to test, reuse, and maintain. Always move logic to a `@Service` layer.
* **Overusing `@Transactional`:** Applying `@Transactional` to read-only methods adds unnecessary overhead. Always use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` for `find` or `get` operations to allow for database-level optimizations.[^20_9]
* **Not Using DTOs:** Exposing JPA entities directly in your API can lead to security risks (leaking internal data) and performance issues (triggering unwanted lazy-loading). Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) as the boundary for your API.

<details>
  <summary>20: Testing</summary>

### Section 20: Testing

Testing is a fundamental practice in software engineering to ensure application correctness, reliability, and maintainability. Spring Boot provides a comprehensive testing framework that makes it easy to write everything from isolated unit tests to full integration tests.

#### Unit Testing with JUnit 5 and Mockito

* **Unit Test:** A test that verifies a single, isolated piece of functionality (a "unit," typically a method or a class).
* **JUnit 5:** The standard framework for writing tests in Java. Key annotations include `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@DisplayName`, etc.
* **Mockito:** A mocking framework used to create "mock" objects that simulate the behavior of real dependencies. This is essential for isolating the unit under test.

**`@Mock` vs. `@MockBean` (IMP):**


| Annotation | Origin | Scope | Use Case |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`@Mock`** | Mockito | Not Spring-aware. | For **plain unit tests** where you are not loading a Spring context. You need to manually inject it using `@InjectMocks` . |
| **`@MockBean`** | Spring Boot Test | Spring-aware. | For **integration tests** or slice tests. It adds a mock object to the Spring `ApplicationContext`, replacing any existing bean of the same type . |

**Example of a Service Unit Test:**

```java
// No Spring context is loaded for this test - it's a pure unit test.
class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private MyRepository myRepository; // Create a mock repository

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService; // Inject the mock into the service

    @Test
    void testGetUser() {
        // Arrange
        when(myRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(new User("test")));

        // Act
        User user = myService.getUser(1L);

        // Assert
        assertEquals("test", user.getName());
        verify(myRepository).findById(1L); // Verify the mock was called
    }
}
```


#### Spring Boot Test Slices (IMP)

Loading the entire application context for every test can be slow. Test slices allow you to load just the parts of the context needed for a specific layer of your application.[^21_1]

* **`@WebMvcTest`**: For testing the **web layer (controllers)**.
  * It auto-configures Spring MVC components (`@Controller`, filters, etc.) and `MockMvc` but does **not** load service or repository beans.
  * You must provide mocks for any dependencies the controller needs, typically using `@MockBean`.

```java
@WebMvcTest(UserController.class)
class UserControllerTest {
    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @MockBean
    private UserService userService;

    // ... tests using mockMvc.perform(...)
}
```

* **`@DataJpaTest`**: For testing the **persistence layer (JPA repositories)**.
  * It auto-configures an in-memory database (like H2), scans for `@Entity` classes and repositories, and configures JPA.
  * **Important:** By default, each test is transactional and is **rolled back** at the end, so tests do not interfere with each other.[^21_2]

```java
@DataJpaTest
class UserRepositoryTest {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    // ... tests for repository methods
}
```


#### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different layers of the application work together correctly.

* **`@SpringBootTest`**: The primary annotation for integration tests. It loads the full application `ApplicationContext`.[^21_3]
  * By default, it uses a mocked web environment. To start a real embedded server for end-to-end testing, use `webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT`.[^21_1]
* **Testing REST APIs:**
  * **RestAssured:** A popular third-party library with a fluent, BDD-style syntax for testing REST APIs. It makes HTTP requests to your running application and validates the response.
  * **WebTestClient:** Spring's own modern, non-blocking client for testing web endpoints. It is the preferred choice for testing reactive (WebFlux) applications but works equally well for traditional Spring MVC.


#### Advanced Testing with Testcontainers (IMP)

While in-memory databases are fast, they can behave differently from your production database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). **Testcontainers** solves this by letting you programmatically spin up lightweight, throwaway Docker containers for your dependencies (databases, Kafka, Redis, etc.) directly from your tests.

* **Benefit:** Allows you to run integration tests against a **real instance** of your database or message broker, providing much higher confidence that your application will work in production.

**Example with a PostgreSQL container:**

```java
@Testcontainers
@SpringBootTest
class MyIntegrationTest {

    @Container
    static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:15-alpine");

    @DynamicPropertySource
    static void setDatasourceProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {
        registry.add("spring.datasource.url", postgres::getJdbcUrl);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.username", postgres::getUsername);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.password", postgres::getPassword);
    }

    // ... your integration tests
}
```


#### Other Important Concepts

* **Test Profiles:** Use `@ActiveProfiles("test")` to load a specific configuration profile (e.g., `application-test.properties`) during tests, allowing you to override properties like the data source URL.
* **`@DirtiesContext`:** An annotation that tells Spring to close and recreate the application context after a test method or class. Use this sparingly, as it slows down your test suite significantly. It's necessary when a test modifies the context in a way that could affect other tests.
* **Spring REST Docs:** Generates accurate and up-to-date API documentation by creating snippets from your integration tests.
* **Spring Cloud Contract:** A framework for Consumer-Driven Contract (CDC) testing, which ensures that services (e.g., a provider and a consumer) can communicate with each other without having to run full end-to-end tests.

### Section 21: OpenAPI - Swagger Integration

**OpenAPI Specification** (formerly Swagger Specification) is a standard for defining and describing RESTful APIs. It allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code or documentation.

**Swagger UI** is a tool that takes an OpenAPI specification and generates an interactive, human-readable API documentation website.

**springdoc-openapi** is a Java library that automates the generation of OpenAPI 3 documentation for Spring Boot applications. It examines your application at runtime—looking at controllers, annotations, and class structures—to infer the API specification automatically.

#### 1. Introduction to `springdoc-openapi` (IMP)

The key benefit of `springdoc-openapi` is its "code-first" approach. You write your Spring Boot controllers as usual, and the documentation is generated for you, ensuring it is always in sync with your code.[^22_1]

**How to set it up:**

1. **Add the dependency:** For a Spring MVC application, add `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui`.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

2. **Run your application:** That's it! No other configuration is required.
  * The OpenAPI specification in JSON format will be available at: `/v3/api-docs`
  * The interactive Swagger UI will be available at: `/swagger-ui/index.html`

#### 2. Customizing the Generated Documentation

While the defaults are good, you often need to add more detail.

* **Annotations for Customization (IMP):**
  * `@Operation(summary = "...", description = "...")`: Describes a single API endpoint (a controller method).
  * `@Tag(name = "...", description = "...")`: Groups related endpoints together under a specific tag name.
  * `@Parameter(description = "...")`: Provides a description for a method parameter.
  * `@ApiResponse(responseCode = "...", description = "...")`: Describes a possible response from an endpoint (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
  * `@Schema(description = "...", example = "...")`: Provides metadata for model properties (fields in your DTOs).[^22_2]

**Example:**

```java
@Tag(name = "User Management", description = "APIs for creating, reading, and updating users")
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @Operation(summary = "Get a user by their ID")
    @ApiResponses(value = {
        @ApiResponse(responseCode = "200", description = "Found the user"),
        @ApiResponse(responseCode = "404", description = "User not found")
    })
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@Parameter(description = "ID of the user to be obtained") @PathVariable Long id) {
        // ...
    }
}

// In your DTO
public class UserDTO {
    @Schema(description = "The unique identifier of the user.", example = "123")
    private Long id;

    @Schema(description = "The full name of the user.", example = "John Doe")
    private String name;
}
```

* **Centralized Configuration:** For global information like the API title, version, or license, create an `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation on a configuration class or define an `OpenAPI` bean.

```java
@Configuration
@OpenAPIDefinition(
    info = @Info(
        title = "My E-commerce API",
        version = "1.0",
        description = "This API provides endpoints for managing products and orders."
    )
)
public class OpenApiConfig {}
```


#### 3. Grouping APIs

For large applications, showing all endpoints on one page can be overwhelming. `springdoc-openapi` allows you to create multiple groups, which appear as a dropdown in the Swagger UI.

* **Implementation:** Define a `GroupedOpenApi` bean for each group you want to create.

```java
@Bean
public GroupedOpenApi userApi() {
    return GroupedOpenApi.builder()
            .group("user-management")
            .pathsToMatch("/api/users/**")
            .build();
}

@Bean
public GroupedOpenApi productApi() {
    return GroupedOpenApi.builder()
            .group("product-catalog")
            .packagesToScan("com.example.products") // An alternative to path matching
            .build();
}
```


#### 4. Linking Security with OpenAPI (IMP)

To let users try out secured endpoints from the Swagger UI, you must describe your security scheme.

* **Implementation:**

1. Define the security scheme using `@SecurityScheme`.
2. Apply it globally or to specific operations using `@SecurityRequirement`.

**Example for JWT Bearer Authentication:**

```java
@Configuration
@SecurityScheme(
    name = "BearerAuth",
    type = SecuritySchemeType.HTTP,
    bearerFormat = "JWT",
    scheme = "bearer"
)
public class OpenApiConfig {}

// Apply it globally in your main class or a controller class
@SecurityRequirement(name = "BearerAuth")
@RestController
public class MyController {
    // ... all endpoints here will be marked as secured
}
```

This will add an "Authorize" button to the Swagger UI, allowing users to paste their JWT token.

#### 5. Important Production Considerations

* **Disabling in Production (IMP):** You should **never** expose your Swagger UI in a production environment as it can provide attackers with a detailed map of your API surface.
* **How to disable:** Use Spring profiles to set properties in your `application-prod.properties` file.

```properties
# application-prod.properties

# Disables the /swagger-ui/index.html page
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=false

# Disables the /v3/api-docs endpoint entirely
springdoc.api-docs.enabled=false
```


#### 6. API Versioning Strategies

How you version your API impacts how it is documented. The most common strategy is **URI Versioning**, as it's explicit and easy to see in the Swagger documentation.

* **Example (URI Versioning):**
  `GET /api/v1/users/{id}`
  `GET /api/v2/users/{id}`
* You can use `GroupedOpenApi` to create separate documentation groups for `v1` and `v2` endpoints.

  <summary>22: Scheduling</summary>

### Section 22: Scheduling

Spring Boot provides a powerful and convenient way to run tasks at specific times or intervals using the `@Scheduled` annotation. This is ideal for automating recurring background processes like generating reports, cleaning up old data, or fetching data from external APIs.

#### 1. Scheduled Tasks with `@Scheduled` (IMP)

This is the core annotation for scheduling tasks in Spring.

* **How to Enable:** You must add the `@EnableScheduling` annotation to one of your configuration classes or your main application class. This annotation detects `@Scheduled` annotations and registers the methods to be run by a task scheduler.
* **Method Requirements:** A method annotated with `@Scheduled` should have a `void` return type and take no arguments.[^23_1]


#### 2. Timing Options for `@Scheduled`

There are three primary ways to define the schedule for a task :

* **`fixedRate`**: Runs the task at a fixed interval of milliseconds. The time is measured from the **start** of each task execution. If a task takes longer than the fixed rate, the next invocation will start immediately after the current one finishes.
  * **Use Case:** Ideal for tasks that need to run at a consistent frequency, regardless of how long they take.

```java
// Runs every 5 seconds
@Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000)
public void runAtFixedRate() {
    System.out.println("Executing task at fixed rate: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
}
```

* **`fixedDelay`**: Runs the task with a fixed delay in milliseconds **between the end of the last execution and the start of the next**. The next task will only start after the previous one has fully completed.
  * **Use Case:** Use this when you need to ensure that one execution is finished before the next one starts.

```java
// Runs 3 seconds after the previous execution completes
@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 3000)
public void runAtFixedDelay() {
    System.out.println("Executing task with fixed delay: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
}
```

* **`cron` (IMP):** The most flexible option. It uses a cron expression to define complex, time-based schedules.[^23_2]
  * **Use Case:** For tasks that need to run at specific times, like "every day at 2 AM" or "at noon on the first Monday of every month".


#### 3. Cron Expressions (IMP)

A cron expression is a string with 6 (or 7) fields representing second, minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week.[^23_2]

`[second] [minute] [hour] [day of month] [month] [day of week]`

**Common Examples:**

* `"0 0 2 * * ?"` - Runs every day at 2:00:00 AM.
* `"0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI"` - Runs at 10:15 AM every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
* `"0 */5 * * * ?"` - Runs every 5 minutes.

```java
// Runs at the top of every hour
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?")
public void runHourlyReport() {
    System.out.println("Generating hourly report...");
}
```


#### 4. Distributed Scheduling Considerations (IMP)

The standard `@Scheduled` annotation has a major limitation in a microservices environment: if you run multiple instances of your application, **each instance will run the scheduled task**. This can lead to duplicate processing, data corruption, and wasted resources.

**Problem:** A task that sends a "daily summary" email will be sent multiple times if you have multiple application instances running.

**Solutions:**

1. **Distributed Lock:** Ensure that only one instance can acquire a lock to run the job at any given time.
  * **ShedLock:** A popular library that provides a lock using a shared database table or a Redis key. The first instance to acquire the lock runs the job, and the others skip it.
  * **Redis Locks:** Manually implement a distributed lock using Redis commands like `SETNX` (set if not exists).
2. **Quartz Scheduler (External Scheduler):** For more robust and advanced scheduling needs, you can integrate with Quartz.
  * **What it is:** Quartz is a full-featured, open-source job scheduling library that can be configured to manage jobs in a clustered environment.
  * **How it works for clustering:** You configure Quartz to use a shared database via a **JDBC JobStore**. All instances connect to the same database. When a job is due, the instances "compete" to acquire a lock on the job in the database. Only one instance will succeed and execute the job, providing automatic failover and load balancing.
    | Feature | Spring `@Scheduled` | Quartz Scheduler |
    | :-- | :-- | :-- |
    | **Simplicity** | Very simple to use for basic tasks. | More complex to set up and configure. |
    | **Clustering** | No built-in support. Requires external locking. | **Built-in support** via JDBC JobStore for high availability and failover [^23_3]. |
    | **Persistence** | In-memory only. If the server restarts, job state is lost. | Can persist job and trigger information to a database [^23_4]. |
    | **Flexibility** | Limited to `fixedRate`, `fixedDelay`, and `cron`. | Highly flexible with complex triggers, calendars, and programmatic scheduling. |

**Best Practice:** For simple, non-critical tasks in a single-node environment, `@Scheduled` is sufficient. For critical, business-level tasks in a distributed, multi-instance environment, a robust solution like **Quartz with a JDBC JobStore** is the recommended approach.

  <summary>23: Logging and Observability</summary>

### Section 23: Logging and Observability

In a distributed system, understanding what is happening inside your application is crucial for debugging and monitoring. **Observability** is the ability to infer a system's internal state from its external outputs, which are often called the "three pillars": **logs**, **metrics**, and **traces**.

#### 1. Logging Frameworks

* **Logback (Default):** Spring Boot uses Logback by default, which is a modern, reliable logging framework.
* **Log4j2 (Recommended):** Log4j2 is the successor to the original Log4j and is generally considered more performant and flexible than Logback, with features like asynchronous loggers. To use it, you must exclude `spring-boot-starter-logging` and include `spring-boot-starter-log4j2`.[^24_1]


#### 2. Structured Logging and MDC (IMP)

* **Structured Logging:** Instead of writing plain text logs, structured logging formats log entries as JSON or another machine-readable format. This makes logs much easier to parse, query, and analyze by centralized logging tools.[^24_2]
* **How to Implement:** Use a library like `logstash-logback-encoder` to configure your `logback-spring.xml` to output JSON logs.

```xml
<!-- logback-spring.xml -->
<appender name="CONSOLE_JSON" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
</appender>
```

* **Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC):** A powerful feature for adding contextual information to your logs. MDC is a thread-local map where you can store key-value pairs (like a `userId` or `requestId`) that are then automatically included in every log statement for that thread's execution.[^24_2]

```java
// In a filter or interceptor
MDC.put("correlationId", uniqueId);
try {
    // ... proceed with request processing
} finally {
    MDC.clear(); // VERY IMPORTANT: clear the MDC to prevent memory leaks
}
```


#### 3. Correlation IDs for Tracing (IMP)

In a microservices architecture, a single user request can trigger a chain of calls across multiple services. To trace this entire flow, you need a **Correlation ID** (also known as a Trace ID).

* **How it Works:**

1. When a request first enters your system (e.g., at the API Gateway), generate a unique ID.
2. Add this ID to the MDC so it appears in all logs for that request.
3. Propagate this ID in the HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Correlation-ID`) to all downstream service calls.
4. Each downstream service reads the ID from the header, adds it to its own MDC, and continues to propagate it.
* **Result:** You can now go into your centralized logging system and search for a single correlation ID to see the complete, end-to-end trail of logs for a specific request across all services.


#### 4. Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry (IMP)

While manually propagating a correlation ID works, modern distributed tracing systems automate this and provide much richer data.

* **Spring Boot 3+ \& OpenTelemetry:** Spring Boot has moved away from Spring Cloud Sleuth and now has first-class support for **OpenTelemetry (OTEL)**, the new industry standard for observability.
* **How it works:**
  * **Trace ID \& Span ID:** A `TraceId` represents the entire end-to-end request. A `SpanId` represents a single unit of work within that trace (e.g., one service call).
  * **Automatic Instrumentation:** Spring Boot, via Micrometer Tracing, automatically creates spans for incoming/outgoing HTTP requests, database calls, etc., and propagates the tracing context for you.[^24_3]
* **Backend Systems:** The collected trace data is sent to a backend like **Zipkin** or Jaeger for visualization, allowing you to see a full flame graph of your request flow and identify bottlenecks.


#### 5. Centralized Logging (IMP)

In a distributed environment, you cannot SSH into dozens of servers to read log files. You need a centralized logging solution to aggregate logs from all your services into one place.

* **ELK Stack:** A very popular stack consisting of:
  * **E**lasticsearch: A powerful search and analytics engine for storing and indexing the logs.
  * **L**ogstash (or Fluentd): A data processing pipeline that ingests logs, transforms them (e.g., parsing JSON), and sends them to Elasticsearch.
  * **K**ibana: A web UI for searching, visualizing, and creating dashboards from the data in Elasticsearch.
* **Grafana Loki:** A newer, highly cost-effective alternative to ELK. It is designed to work seamlessly with Prometheus and Grafana. Instead of indexing the full content of logs, Loki only indexes a small set of labels (like `app`, `namespace`), which makes it much cheaper to run.


#### 6. Tracing in Asynchronous \& Reactive Flows

A common challenge is losing the tracing context when switching threads (e.g., in an `@Async` method or a reactive pipeline).

* **The Problem:** A new thread does not automatically inherit the MDC or tracing context from the parent thread.
* **The Solution:**
  * **Micrometer Context Propagation:** Spring Boot and Project Reactor now include built-in support for context propagation. It automatically wraps thread pools and reactive operators to ensure that the tracing context (and other thread-local values) is correctly passed from one thread to another. You just need to ensure you are using the context-aware executors provided by Spring.


#### 7. OpenTelemetry Collector

The **OTEL Collector** is a vendor-agnostic agent that can receive, process, and export telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces).

* **Deployment:** It can be deployed as a standalone service or as a **sidecar** container alongside your application in environments like Kubernetes.
* **Benefits:** It decouples your application from the specific monitoring backend. Your application just sends data to the Collector, and the Collector can be configured to forward that data to multiple backends (e.g., Prometheus, Zipkin, and a logging service) simultaneously without any changes to your application code.

  <summary>24: Internationalisation (i18n)</summary>

### Section 24: Internationalisation (i18n)

Internationalisation (often abbreviated as **i18n**) is the process of designing an application so that it can be easily adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Spring Boot provides excellent, auto-configurable support for i18n.

#### 1. Message Bundles and `MessageSource` (IMP)

The core of i18n in Spring is the `MessageSource` interface, which is responsible for resolving text messages from resource bundles based on a given locale.[^25_1]

* **Message Bundles:** These are a set of properties files that contain the translated text. You create a separate file for each language you want to support, following a specific naming convention: `basename_locale.properties`.
  * `src/main/resources/messages.properties` (The default fallback file)
  * `src/main/resources/messages_en_US.properties` (English, US)
  * `src/main/resources/messages_fr.properties` (French)
  * `src/main/resources/messages_de.properties` (German)

**Example `messages_fr.properties`:**

```properties
welcome.message=Bienvenue dans notre application
```

* **Auto-Configuration:** Spring Boot automatically configures a `MessageSource` bean if it finds a `messages.properties` file at the root of your classpath. You can customize the base name using the `spring.messages.basename` property.


#### 2. `LocaleResolver` and `LocaleChangeInterceptor` (IMP)

How does the application know which locale to use for a given request? This is the job of the `LocaleResolver`.

* **`LocaleResolver`**: An interface that determines the current user's locale. Spring Boot provides several implementations:
  * **`AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver` (Default):** Resolves the locale from the `Accept-Language` HTTP header sent by the browser. This is the default behavior.[^25_2]
  * **`SessionLocaleResolver`:** Stores the locale in the user's `HttpSession`.
  * **`CookieLocaleResolver`:** Stores the locale in a cookie on the user's browser, allowing the preference to be remembered across sessions.
* **`LocaleChangeInterceptor`**: To allow users to actively switch their language, you need an interceptor that detects a parameter in the request and changes the locale.

**How to configure runtime locale switching:**
You must define beans for both the `LocaleResolver` and the `LocaleChangeInterceptor`.

```java
@Configuration
public class LocaleConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    // 1. Define the LocaleResolver bean (e.g., store locale in a cookie)
    @Bean
    public LocaleResolver localeResolver() {
        CookieLocaleResolver resolver = new CookieLocaleResolver();
        resolver.setDefaultLocale(Locale.US); // Set a default locale
        return resolver;
    }

    // 2. Define the interceptor bean
    @Bean
    public LocaleChangeInterceptor localeChangeInterceptor() {
        LocaleChangeInterceptor interceptor = new LocaleChangeInterceptor();
        interceptor.setParamName("lang"); // Looks for a request parameter named "lang"
        return interceptor;
    }

    // 3. Register the interceptor
    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        registry.addInterceptor(localeChangeInterceptor());
    }
}
```

With this configuration, a request to `GET /home?lang=fr` will switch the user's locale to French for the current and subsequent requests (because it's stored in a cookie).

#### 3. Supporting Multiple Languages in APIs

To use the localized messages in your code (e.g., in a controller to return a localized error message), you inject the `MessageSource` bean.

```java
@RestController
public class GreetingController {

    @Autowired
    private MessageSource messageSource;

    @GetMapping("/welcome")
    public String getWelcomeMessage() {
        // Get the current locale resolved by the LocaleResolver
        Locale currentLocale = LocaleContextHolder.getLocale();

        // Fetch the message for the "welcome.message" key using the current locale
        return messageSource.getMessage("welcome.message", null, "Default Welcome Message", currentLocale);
    }
}
```

* `LocaleContextHolder.getLocale()`: A convenient utility to get the locale for the current request thread.[^25_2]
* `messageSource.getMessage()`: The method to retrieve a message. It takes the message key, an array of arguments for parameterized messages, a default message, and the target locale.[^25_2]


#### 4. Formatting Dates and Numbers

Different regions format dates, times, and numbers differently (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY` vs. `DD.MM.YYYY`). Hardcoding formats is a common i18n mistake.

* **Best Practice:** Use Java's built-in, locale-aware formatters.
  * **`java.text.DateFormat`:** The traditional way to format dates and times in a locale-sensitive manner.[^25_3]

```java
Date now = new Date();
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance(DateFormat.LONG, DateFormat.LONG, locale);
String formattedDate = df.format(now);
```

    * **`java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` (Modern):** The preferred approach for Java 8+ `java.time` objects.

```java
ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now();
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter
        .ofLocalizedDateTime(FormatStyle.FULL)
        .withLocale(locale);
String formattedDate = now.format(formatter);
```

This ensures that dates and numbers are always displayed in a format that is familiar to the user.

  <summary>25: Deployment and Packaging</summary>

### Section 25: Deployment and Packaging

Spring Boot is designed to simplify deployment by providing flexible packaging options and seamless integration with containerization, cloud platforms, and scalable environments.

#### 1. Fat JAR vs. WAR Packaging (IMP)

| Format | Purpose \& Usage | Best For | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Fat JAR** | All dependencies bundled into a single executable JAR. Can be run as `java -jar myapp.jar`. | Standalone services, microservices | Default for Spring Boot; leverages embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow). |
| **WAR** | Web Application Archive. Intended for deployment to external servlet containers (Tomcat, WildFly, etc.). | Legacy Java EE servers, phased migration | Spring Boot WARs can still be run with `java -jar myapp.war`. |
| **Best Practice:** Use **fat JAR** unless you must integrate with an existing application server . |  |  |  |

#### 2. Dockerizing Spring Boot Apps

Spring Boot makes it easy to build Docker images:

* **Cloud Native Buildpacks** (preferred): Use the Gradle or Maven `bootBuildImage` command to build an optimized Docker image with no custom Dockerfile required.[^27_1]

```bash
./gradlew bootBuildImage
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
```

* **Custom Dockerfile:** For full control, use a multi-stage Dockerfile to build and run your app, minimizing the image size.[^27_2]
* **Gradle Integration:** The Docker image name can be set using the `bootBuildImage` task or as part of your CI/CD pipeline.[^27_3]
* **Layered JAR Optimization:** Spring Boot builds layered JARs so that unchanged dependencies are cached separately, speeding up Docker builds.[^27_4]


#### 3. Systemd / Service Runners

* On Linux, run your Spring Boot app as a systemd service for automatic restart on failure or server reboot, log rotation, and easy management.

```
[Unit]
Description=Spring Boot App
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
User=myuser
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /path/to/myapp.jar
Restart=always
Environment="SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* View logs with `journalctl -u my-application.service`.


#### 4. Deploying to AWS / GCP / Azure

* **AWS:** Copy your JAR to an EC2 instance, run as systemd service or use Elastic Beanstalk. Use S3 for artifact storage and CodePipeline for CI/CD.
* **GCP:** Use Google App Engine, Cloud Run, or Kubernetes Engine for containerized deployment.
* **Azure:** Deploy directly to App Service or as a container in Azure Container Instances or AKS.
* **Spring Cloud Native \& K8s Readiness:** Use liveness/readiness probes in your deployment YAML (`/actuator/health/liveness`, `/actuator/health/readiness`).


#### 5. JVM Flags for Production Tuning (IMP)

| Flag | Purpose/Benefit |
| :-- | :-- |
| `-Xms2g -Xmx2g` | Set initial \& max heap to same value |
| `-XX:+UseG1GC` | Optimal GC for throughput/latency |
| `-XX:+UseStringDeduplication` | Saves memory in string-heavy workloads |
| `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError` | Take heap dump on crash for diagnostics |
| `-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError` | Ensures auto-restart in containers |
| `-XX:+UseContainerSupport` | JVM respects Docker/K8s limits |
| `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` | Sets encoding (preventing locale bugs) |
| `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200` | Tuning GC pause times |
| Additional flags for advanced tuning: see . |  |

#### 6. Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies (IMP)

| Strategy | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Rolling Update** | Gradually updates instances, maintains availability. |
| **Blue-Green** | Two identical environments; traffic switched to new. |
| **Canary Release** | Gradually routes traffic to new version for testing. |
| **Feature Toggles** | Enable/disable features at runtime for controlled rollout. |
| **Best Practice:** In K8s or with service mesh, use readiness/liveness probes, automate health checks, and provide automated rollbacks . |  |

#### 7. Gradle-based Docker Image Creation

* Use Gradle `bootBuildImage` with Cloud Native Buildpacks for efficient image layering and plugin configuration for naming.
* Multi-stage Dockerfiles maximize cache reuse, reduce image size, and are recommended for non-standard requirements.[^27_2]


#### 8. Layered JARs and Dockerfile Optimisations

* Spring Boot's layered JARs separate dependencies, application code, and resources. Docker caches unchanged layers, enabling fast, incremental builds.

  <summary>26: Spring AI</summary>

### Section 26: Spring AI

**Spring AI** is a powerful extension to the Spring ecosystem that allows enterprise-grade applications to easily integrate and orchestrate AI capabilities like generative Large Language Models (LLMs), embeddings, vector stores, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and much more.

#### 1. What is Spring AI? Use Cases (IMP)

* **Purpose:** Spring AI lets Java developers connect to LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, HuggingFace, NVIDIA, etc.), create REST endpoints for AI-powered features, integrate with vector databases, and control advanced generative AI workflows—using familiar Spring Boot conventions.
* **Use Cases:**
  * Text generation and chat interfaces
  * Document similarity search and Q\&A (using vectors)
  * Fraud detection and anomaly analysis via ML models
  * AI-powered function calling and RAG
  * Evaluation/experimentation for best LLM provider


#### 2. LLM Provider Integrations

* Spring AI supports:
  * **OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, HuggingFace, NVIDIA, Google Vertex AI**, and more.
* **Switching LLMs:** Change dependencies and configuration properties—your code remains unchanged.[^28_1]
* **A/B Testing:** Run side-by-side experiments to find the best cost or quality tradeoff (swap starters, update `.properties`).


#### 3. Prompt Templating and Chaining

* The foundation of AI interaction is the **Prompt**, which you craft using annotations or template files. Prompts can be chained to break a complex workflow into smaller steps—ideal for workflow agents, multi-step content creation, etc..
  * Workflow Example: Research phase prompt → structure phase prompt → content creation → polish.


#### 4. REST Endpoints Powered by LLMs

* Easily expose AI logic via REST controllers using `Prompt` and LLM client beans.

```java
@RestController
public class ChatController {
    private final ChatClient chatClient;
    @Autowired
    public ChatController(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
        this.chatClient = builder.build();
    }
    @GetMapping("/ai/generate")
    public String generate(@RequestParam String message) {
        return chatClient.prompt().user(message).call().content();
    }
}
```

* **Streaming Responses:** For real-time output (e.g., chat, long completions), support streaming via server-sent events or reactive types.[^28_2]


#### 5. Connecting to Vector Databases

* Spring AI supports popular vector DBs for storage and retrieval of embeddings—including **pgVector**, **Redis**, Weaviate, and others.
* **Pluggable Strategy:** Swap vector DB implementations via Spring Boot starter dependencies and simple config changes.[^28_1]


#### 6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* RAG enriches LLM context by searching data stored as embeddings in a vector store, retrieving relevant documents, and providing richer, factual responses.
  * **Spring AI RAG API:** Advisors orchestrate context retrieval/search before LLM inference. Document readers support a range of formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).


#### 7. Token Limits, Retries, and Streaming

* Control token usage for cost management. Configure limits and policies for handling large inputs, retries, and streaming responses via Spring AI's integrations.
  * Use OpenAI chat options (`maxTokens` / `maxCompletionTokens`) per model requirements.[^28_3]
  * Enable token/rate-limit metrics in production (`spring.ai.openai.metadata.rate-limit-metrics-enabled=true`).[^28_4]
  * Streaming for long responses or interactive sessions.[^28_2]


#### 8. Securing LLM APIs

* Secure AI endpoints via:
  * JWT/mTLS authentication (standard with Spring Security)
  * API throttling/rate limiting for expensive operations
  * Token quotas and monitoring via AI provider APIs[^28_4]


#### 9. Spring AI Starters and Configuration

* All features are enabled via starter dependencies and configuration in `application.properties`. No complex wiring is needed; relies on Spring Boot conventions.


#### 10. LangChain4j Interoperability and Prompt Evaluation

* Spring AI is aware of **LangChain4j** workflows and interoperates with prompt/chain strategies. You can evaluate prompts and workflows using integrated tools and metrics for A/B testing and fine-tuning.[^28_1]


#### 11. Vector DB Comparison

| Feature | Redis | pgVector | Weaviate |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Type** | In-memory/Hybrid | Postgres extension | Standalone DB |
| **Scale** | High | Database-scale | Cloud-native |
| **Best For** | Fast cache, session | OLAP, deep search | ML-centric workflows |
| **Spring AI** | Out-of-the-box | Smooth integration | Supported |

**Best Practice:** Use vector DB best suited for your search/embedding needs. For RAG and contextual enterprise search, pgVector and Redis are commonly favored.
