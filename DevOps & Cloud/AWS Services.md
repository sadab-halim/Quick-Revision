    - Installing updates
    - Installing software
    - Downloading common files from the internet
    - Anything you can think of
    - The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root use"

## Use of Different EC2 Instances Types
### General Purpose
- Balance of **compute**, **memory** and **networking** resources
- Use Cases:
    - Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers and code repositories

### Compute Optimized
- Ideal for **compute bound applications** that benefit from **high performance** processor
- Use Cases:
    - scientific modeling
    - dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines
    - batch processing workloads
    - media transcoding
    - high performance web servers
    - high perforamce computing (HPC)

### Memory Optimized
- **Fast performance** for workloads that process **large data sets in memory**
- Use Cases:
    - in-memory caches
    - in-memory databases
    - real time big data analytics
    - high performance
    -  relational/non-relational databases
    -  distributed web scale cache stored

## EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
- **On-Demand Instances**:
- **Reserved**: (1 & 3 years)
    - **Reserved Instances**: long workloads
    - **Convertible Reserved Instances**: long workloads with flexible instances
- **Savings Plan** (1 & 3 years): commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
- **Spot Instances**: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
- **Dedicated Hosts**: book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- **Dedicated Instances**: no other cusomters will share your hardware
- **Capacity Reservations**: reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

## Which purchasing option is right for me?
- **On demand**: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- **Reserved**: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
- **Savings Plans**: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g.,King, Suite, Sea View, …)
- **Spot instances**: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
- **Dedicated Hosts**: We book an entire building of the resort
- **Capacity Reservations**: you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it

## Shared Responsibility Model for EC2
| AWS | User |
| --- | ---- |
| Infrastructure (global network security) | Security Groups rules |

## IAM Roles for Services
- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will *assign permissions* to AWS services
  with IAM Roles
- Common roles:
    - EC2 Instance Roles
    - Lambda Function Roles
    - Roles for CloudFormation


## IAM Security Tools
- **IAM Credentials Report** *(account-level)*
    -  a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
- **IAM Access Advisor** *(user-level)*
    - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
    - You can use this information to revise your policies.

## IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
- Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM
  Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

## Shared Responsibility Model for IAM
| AWS | User |
| --- | ---- |
| Infrastructure *(global network security)* | Users, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring |

- If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket
  policy allows public reads!

## Amazon S3 - Versioning
- You can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will change the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
- It is best practice to version your buckets
    - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
    - Easy roll back to previous version
- Notes:
    - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
    - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

## Global Infrastructure - Resources
- Global Infrastructure is a **globally distributed hardware** and **datacenters** that are **physically networked together** to act os one large source for the end user
- **6 Resources for Global Infrastructure**:
    - **32** Launched Regions
    - **102** Availability Zones
    - **115** Direct Connection Locations
    - **550+** PoP
    - Local Zones
    - **29** Wavelength Zones

### Global Infrastructure - Regions
- Regions are geographically distinct locations consisting of one or more AZs.
- AWS First Region: US-East 1 (N Virigina)
- Every region is physically isolated from & independent of every other regions in terms of location, power, water supply
- Each region has generally **3 AZs**.
- All your billing information appears in US-East-1 (North Virginia)
- When you choose a region there are 4 factors you need to consider:
    - What regulatory compliace does this region meet?
    - What is the cost of AWS services in this region?
    - What AWS services are available in this region?
    - What is the distance or latency to my end-users?

### Global Infrastructure - Regional vs Global Services
- **Regional Services**:
    - AWS scopes their AWS Management Console on a selected Region.
    - This will determine where an AWS service will be launched and what will be seen within an AWS service's console.
    - You generally don't explicitly set the Region for a service at the time of creation.

- **Global Services**:
    - Some AWS services operate across multiple regions and the region will be fixed to "Global". E.g. Amazon S3, CloudFront, Route53, IAM
    - For these global services at the time of creation:
        - a. Their is no concept of region e.g. IAM User
        - b. A single region must be explicitly choosen e.g. S3 Bucket
        - c. A group of regions are choosen e.g. CloudFront Distribution

## Global Infrastructure - Availability Zone
- An **Availability Zone (AZ)** is a physical location made up of one or more datacenter
- A **datacenter** is a secured building that contains hundreds of thosands of computers
- A region will *generally contain 3 AZs
- Datacenters within a region will isolate from each other (diff buildings) But they will be close enough to provide low-latency (<10 ms)

- **High Availability**: Its common practice to run workloads in at least 3 AZs to ensure services remain available in case one or two datacenters fail.
- AZs are represented by a region code, followed by a letter identifier, e.g. us-east-1a

- **Remember**: A subnet is associated with an AZ. You never choose the AZ when launching resources, you choose the subnet which is associated to the AZ. The US-East-1 region has 6 AZs (the most AZ of any region)

- **Connection**: All AZs in an AWS region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networing, over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between. All traffic b/w AZ is encrypted. AZs are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.

## Global Infrastructure - Fault Tolerance
- **Fault Domain**:
    - A fault domain is a section of a network that is vulnerable to damage if a critical device or system fails.
    - The purpose of fault domain is that if a failure occurs it'll not cascade outside that domain, limiting the damage possible.
    - You can have fault domains nested inside fault domains.
- **Fault Level**: A fault level is a collection of fault domains
- An AWS Region would be a **Fault Level**
- A Availability Zone would be a **Fault Domain**
- Each Amazon Region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Amazon Regions. *(this achieves the greated possible fault tolerance and stability)*
- Each AZ is isolated, but the AZ in a Region are connected through low-latency links. Each AZ is designed as an independent **failure zone.**
- **Failure Zone**:
    - a. AZs are physically separated within a typical metropolitann region and are located in lower risk flood plains
    - b. Discrete uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and onsite backup generation facilities
    - c. Data centers located in different AZs are designed to be supplied by independent substances to reduce the risk of an event on the power grid impacting more than one AZ
    - d. AZs are all redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers
- **Multi-AZ for High Availability**: If an application is partitioned across AZs, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and more.

## AWS Global Network
- The AWS Global Network represents the interconnections b/w AWS Global Infrastructure.
- Commonly referred to as the "The Backbone of AWS".
- Think of it as a private expressway, where things can move very fast between datacenters
- Edge Locations can act as on and off ramps to the AWS Global  Network
- **Amazon CloudFront**: uses edge locations as an off-ramp, to provide at the Edge storage and compute near the end user.
- **AWS Global Network & AWS S3 Acceleration**: uses edge locations as an on-ramp, to quickly reach AWS resources in other regions by traversing the fast AWS Global Network
- **VPC Endpoints**: ensuring your resources stay within the AWS Network and do not traverse over the public internet.

## Global Infrastructure - Points of Presence (PoP)
- Points of Presence is an intermediate location b/w an AWS region and the end userm and this location could be a datacenter or collection of hardware.
- For AWS a PoP is a data center owned by AWS or a trusted partner that is utilized by AWS Services related for content delivery or expediated upload.
- PoP resources are: a. Edge Locations, b. Regional Edge Caches. PoPs live at the edge/intersections of 2 networks.
- **Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration**: allows you to generate a special URL that can be used by end users to upload files to a nearby Edge Location. Once a file is uploaded to an Edge Location, it can move much faster within the AWS Network to reach S3

## Networking Terminologies
- **VPC**: a **logically isolated section** of the AWS cloud where you can l**aunch AWS resources**
- **Region**: the **geographical location** of your network
- **AZ**: the **datacenter** of your AWS resources
- **Route Table**: determine where network traffic from your subnets are directed
- **Internet Gateway**: enables access to the internet
- **Subnets** a logical **partition** of an **IP network** into multiple, **smaller network segments**
- **NACLs**: acts as firewall at the **subnet** level
- **Security Groups** acts as firewall at the **instance** level, they control how traffic is allowed into or out of the EC2 instances
- **AWS PrivateLinks (VPC Endpoint Services)**:

    - Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables…
    - Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC)

## Security Groups vs NACLs
- **NACLs**: Acts as virtual firewall at the **subnet** level, you can create **allow** and **deny** rules
- **Security Groups**: Acts as virtual firewall at the **instance** level, implicitly **denies all traffic**, u can create **only allow** rules

## In-Transit vs At-Rest Encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: Data that is secure when moving between locations, Alogirhtms: **TLS, SSL**
- **Encryption at Rest**: Data that is secure when residing on storage or witihin a database, Algorithms: **AES, RSA**

- AWS Account Root User is a special user who is created at the time of AWS account creation
- **AWS Account** - the account which holds all your AWS resources
- **AWS Account -- Root User** - a special account with full access that cannot be deleted
- **AWS Account -- User** - a user for common tasks that is assigned permissions
- The Root User account uses an Email and Password to login
- A regular user has to provide the Account ID / Alias, Username and Password
- The Root User account cannot be deleted
- The Root User account has full permissions to the account and its permissions cannot be limited
- You cannot use IAM policies to explicitly deny the root user access to resources
- You can only use an AWS Organizations Service Control Policy (SCP) to limit the permissions of the root user (Imp)
- There can be only one Root user per AWS account
- The root user is used for very specific and specialized tasks that are infrequently or rarely performed
- An AWS Root Account should not be used for daily or common tasks
- Its strongly recommended to never use Root User Access Keys
- Its strongly recommended to turn on MFA for the Root User

# Domain 1: Cloud Concepts
## Cloud Architecture Terminologies
- **Availability**: your ability to ensure a service remains available e.g. **Highly Available (HA)**
- **Scalability**: your ability to **grow rapidly** or unimpeded
- **Elasticity**: your ability to **shrink** and **grow** to meet the demand
- **Fault Tolerance**: your ability to **prevent a failure**
- **Durability**: your ability to **recover from a failure** e.g. **Highly Durable (DR)**

## High Availability
- your ability for your service to **remain available** by ensuring there is **no single point of failure** and/or ensure a certain level of performance
- **Elastic Load Balancer**:
    - A load balancer allows you to **evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in one datacenter**.
    - If a datacenter or server becomes unavailable **(unhealthy)** the load balancer will route the traffic to only advailable datacenters with servers.
- running your workload across multiple **Availability Zones** ensures that if 1 or 2 **AZs** become unavailable your service / applications remains available.

## High Scalability
- your ability to **increase your capacity** based on the increasing demand of traffic, memory and computing power
- **Types of Scaling**:
    - **Vertical Scaling**: Scaling Up - upgrade to a bigger server
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Scaling Out - add more servers of the same size

## High Elasticity
- your ability to **automatically** increase or decrease your capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory and computing power
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: is an AWS feature that will automatically add or remove servers based on scaling rules you define based on metrics
- **Types of Horizontal Scaling**:
    - **Scaling Out**: add more servers of the same size
    - **Scaling In**: removing underutilized servers of the same size
- **Vertical Scaling**: is generally hard for traditional architecture so u'll usually only see horizontal scaling described with Elasiticy

## High Fault Tolerant
- your ability for your service to ensure there is **no single point of failure**. Preventing the **chance of failure**.
- **Fail-overs**: is when you have a plan to **shift trafic** to a redundant system in case the primary system fails
- **RDS Multi-AZ**: is when you run a duplicate standby database in another Availability Zone in case your primary database fails
- **Exampple**: having a copy (secondary) of your database where all ongoing changes are synced. The secondary system is not in-use until a fail over occurs and it becomes the primary database.

## High Durability
- your ability to **recover** from a disaster and to prevent **the loss of data**. solutions that recover from a disaster is known as **Disaster Recovery (DR)**

## Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
- BCP is a document that oulines how a business will continue operating **during an unplanned disruption in services**
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: the maximum acceptable amount of data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident, expressed as an amount of time, *how much data are you willing to lose?*
- **Recovery Time Objective (RPO)**: the maximum amount of downtime your business can tolerate without incurring a significant financial loss, *how much time are you willing to go down?*

## AWS Well-Architected Framework (General Definitions) - 6 Pillars
- **Operational Excellence**: run and monitor systems
- **Security**: protect data and systems, mitigate risk
- **Reliability**: mitigate and recover from disruptions
- **Performance Efficiency**: use computing resources effectively
- **Cost Optimization**: get the lowest price

<br/>

- **Component**: code, configuration and AWS resource against a requirement
- **Workload**: a set of components that work together to deliver business value
- **Milestones**: key changes of your architecture through product life cycle
- **Architecture**: how componenets work together in a workload
- **Technology Portfolio**: a collection of workloads required for the business to operate

## Well-Architecting Framework General Guiding Principles
- Stop guessing your capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
    - Design based on changing requirements
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days
    - Simulate applications for flashy sale days

## AWS Cloud Best Practices - Design Principles
- **Scalability**: vertical & horizontal
- **Disposable Resources**: servers should be disposable & easily configured
- **Automation**: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling…
- **Loose Coupling**:
    - Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger
    - Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components
    - A change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components
- **Services, not Servers**:
    - Don't use just EC2
    - Use managed services

    - Automatically applied to the resource you create
    - Starts with Prefix aws: (e.g. aws: createdBy)
- **User-defined tags**
    - Defined by the user
    - Starts with prefix **user:**

## Tagging and Resource Groups
- **Tags** are used for organizing resources:
    - EC2: instances, images, load balancers, security groups…
    - RDS, VPC resources, Route 53, IAM users, etc…
    - Resources created by CloudFormation are all tagged the same way
- Free naming, common tags are: Name, Environment, Team …
- Tags can be used to create **Resource Groups**
    - Create, maintain, and view a collection of resources that share common tags
    - Manage these tags using the Tag Editor

## Cost and Usage Reports
- Dive deeper into your AWS costs and usage
- The AWS Cost & Usage Report contains **the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available**, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, and reservations *(e.g., Amazon EC2, Reserved Instances (RIs)).*
- The AWS Cost & Usage Report lists AWS usage for each service category used by an account and its IAM users in hourly or daily line items, as well as any tags that you have activated for cost allocation purposes.
- Can be integrated with Athena, Redshift or QuickSight

## Cost Explorer
- Visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time
- Create custom reports that analyze cost and usage data.
- Analyze your data at a high level: total costs and usage across all accounts
- Or Monthly, hourly, resource level granularity
- Choose an optimal **Savings Plan** (to lower prices on your bill)
- **Forecast usage up to 12 months based on previous usage**

## Billing Alarms in CloudWatch
- **Billing data metric is stored** in ***CloudWatch us-east-1***
- Billing data are for overall *worldwide* AWS costs
- It’s for actual cost, not for projected costs
- Intended a simple alarm (not as powerful as AWS Budgets)

## AWS Budgets
- Create budget and **send alarms when costs exceeds the budget**
- 4 types of budgets: Usage, Cost, Reservation, Savings Plans
- For Reserved Instances (RI)
    - Track utilization
    - Supports EC2, ElastiCache, RDS, Redshift
- Up to 5 SNS notifications per budget
- Can filter by: Service, Linked Account, Tag, Purchase Option, Instance Type, Region, Availability Zone, API Operation, etc…
- Same options as AWS Cost Explorer!
- 2 budgets are free, then $0.02/day/budget

## AWS Cost Anomaly Detection
- **Continuously monitor your cost and usage using ML to detect unusual spends**
- It learns your unique, historic spend patterns to detect one-time cost spike and/or continuous cost increases (you don’t need to define thresholds)
- Monitor AWS services, member accounts, cost allocation tags, or cost categories
- Sends you the anomaly detection report with root-cause analysis
- Get notified with individual alerts or daily/weekly summary (using SNS)
